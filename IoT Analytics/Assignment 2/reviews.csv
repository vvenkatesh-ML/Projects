Review 1,I travel alot and really enjoyed my stay here. The hotel was very clean and the staff very professional. It took me only 5 minutes to make it to downtown and the campus is beautiful. Will stay again soon.
Review 2,"Stayed one night for a seminar at the University. Clean, comfortable room (nice bed!) with plenty of space. Squeaky clean. Shower temp was a little on the cool side, even at full hot. Air handling unit was a bit loud; could not shut it off despite thermostat in room. But these were minor inconveniences for an otherwise pleasant stay. Nice staff. Free wi-fi. Limited restaurant options with walking distance; Eric's restaurant in the hotel was decent."
Review 3,"I stayed at the the BW Downtown on two separate business trips in Nov. 2011. The access to downtown is perfect--a 10 minute walk to the office, although the shuttle is availble free of charge. The rooms are a bit larger than average, and the beds and bedding were very comfortable. One thing that struck me is that the place is very quiet--the hallways and stairs were recarpeted recently with heavy underlay and you don't notice people walking up and down the halls. There is a pool and hottub that I did not take advantage of. The complimentary breakfast every morning is great--eggs, bacon, sausage, yoghurt, toast, juice, coffee, etc. In the evening there are complimentary snacks and beverages as well. The high speed internet worked fine; much better than at larger places I've stayed at.
There are many restaurants and pubs nearby and the Galleria is about a 20 min drive. River Oaks is quite close for shopping as well and the theatre district is very close. The Texas Art Supply is about 5 minutes away on Montrose, and on Westheimer about 10 min away there are a bunch of eclectic antique stores that are worth checking out on the weekend.
Access to the airport is very good-- about a 30 minute drive on I-45 with no tolls.
I will definately stay here again. The staff are very friendly and they really do make sure that your stay is comfortable."
Review 4,"This is my first year to go to with a group of Quilter from southeast Kansas to the International Quilt Festival. We have never stayed in a hotel that was so accommodating. We were glad to see that the shuttle was extended for the weekend to accommodate all of us. Especially me when I forgot my prescription medicine and they were more than happy to take me to the pharmacy! Thanks you Jo, Sonny, John and all the other staff for making my once a year trip the best!!! I hope to you see you next year."
Review 5,"I travel with several friends (we're from a small town) for a ""girl's weekend"" once a year to big-city Houston for the International Quilt Festival. We have stayed at the Best Western Downtown for the last 8 years and have always had a great stay! We've found the staff (Jo, Sonny, John & all the others) more than willing to help us out in any way they can. We especially appreciated the extended weekend shuttle this year!"
Review 6,"Estuve hospedado en este hotel en diciembre 2010 por espacio de una semana. Las instalaciones estan bien, asi como las habitaciones, amplias y limpias. 2 camas matrimoniales, un sofa cama, un sillon reclinador, cocina equipada. El servicio de limpieza es una vez por semana, pero se pueden cambiar las toallas en la recepcion. Tiene muy cerca un Walmart, Target, Best Buy, para comer un Golden Corral. Se puede ir caminando a cada uno de estos sitios. El internet inalmabrico cuesta 4.99$ por toda la estadia y es rapido y funciono genial. La zona es segura, no vi nada extra√±o. Queda a 10 minutos del downtown de houston, de las atracciones como el parque hermann, los museos tambien queda cerca como 15 minutos en auto. El desayuno es muy basico y pobre, pan, mermelada queso crema y cafe, algo de frutas como manzanas y naranja. Tiene una impresora inalambrica en la recepcion donde poder imprimir cualquier documento. En general, la estadia fue bien."
Review 7,"Attending a business conference at the University. Room was large with two comfortable beds and adequate pillows. As is common in many hotels, the chair and hassock were too stylish to be practical and comfortable, useless to try to sit, put for feet up and read. Would take a balancing act. Desk and work space were superior. Nice in room Lavazza coffee set up. Bathroom was superior. Spacious, clean. Shower was a water saver head, but worked pretty well.
I asked for late check-out and this was not a problem, also the screw came out of my reading glasses and when I asked at the front desk for some tape (yes, nerd-style) to wrap around the hinge, surprise, the desk clerk pulled out a tiny optical screw-driver. Be aware, parking is $15 a night for guests, but some room rates include this. Bar and restaurant food and drinks were good and service was very pleasant, but both a dinner and breakfast the wait staff seemed to disappear for 15 minutes right when I was ready to pay and leave. Might have been light on the staff. Hotel is a circuitous 6 miles from Hobby, but GPS worked well, signs are poor. Beware the security line at Hobby can be 40 minutes during mid-afternoon."
Review 8,"This is the second time I have used this hotel and booked this last time because of the perceived value.
Room is updated and staff is great ...but woke this morning to bedbugs. I travel alot for work and this is the first time I have seen these in person.
 Staff went right after the room but... They are present :( so beware upon checking into the room."
Review 9,"Hotel was perfect. Recent remodel last year, rooms great, very, very clean bathrooms, glass showers, big vanities. University was closed, so ate in the ground floor restaurant. The french fries alone are worth a trip back. $15 cab ride from Hobby Airport.
Had a single room for my niece who was starting school, suite for my wife and me. Stay here....you'll like it."
Review 10,"We only stayed one night while visiting the University of Houston, but it was very enjoyable. As part of their program, there are many students involved in running the hotel. They were very courteous and helpful. It is a very nice hotel and well worth staying at if you are visiting the campus or just in the area."
Review 11,"We were greeted upon arrival by a nice man named Sonny, He assured us that we would be able to use the shuttle to and from the Houston International Quilt Festival. That was a load off our minds as 5 women trying to get a taxi might be a hard thing to do.
We had a wonderful continental breakfast consisting of bacon, sausage, scrambled eggs, hard boiled eggs, waffles, bagels, toast, Danish, fruit, yogurt, cereals, oatmeal, a juice bar with orange, grape apple and cranberry, They had 3 kinds of coffee, teas, and bottled water.What more could you ask for
Although the weather turned a little cold while we were there, the hot tub was a welcome comfort on tired, achy feet upon returning from the Quilt show.
The desk clerk Jo was helpful. One of our ladies had forgotten her prescription and John was nice enough to take us to a pharmacy to get it refilled.
The beds were awesome with 4 pillows, down comforters and sheets that were not only soft but smelled sooooooooo clean. We had bottled water and cookies left for us each day.
This hotel is very clean and I would recommend staying here to anyone."
Review 12,"This hotel is one of my favorites! The staff is first class and will help you with any needs, whether you forgot your shaving kit, need a restaurant recommendation or need a ride to a restaurant they are there to serve you.
When staying here make sure you get to know Sonny. Sonny has helped my business colleagues and me with dinner recommendations and then given us rides to the restaurants. 
This is a great hotel for business, is close to downtown and is in the area they call mid-town, which appears to be going through a bit of a renaissance. Many restaurants, bars, cafes, coffee shops etc near by. I will be staying here again."
Review 13,"This is by far the nicest Best Western I have ever been to while on vacation. My husband and I stayed here on a weekend get-away for his birthday. The woman working the front desk was super polite and helpful - she called us a cab and even made dinner reservations for us before our concert at the House of Blues! The service was much better then I thought we would get. The room was HUGE, super clean and very comfy. We got turn down service twice while we were there and found our mini bar restocked each time we came back to our room. When heading back to Houston, I will make it a point to book this hotel."
Review 14,I had to make a visit to Houston to see my brother who had a stroke. I came on a red eye trip 7am - so I was very tired. Jo ( front desk lady) let us check in early and let us get some breakfast. The rooms were so spacious. The hotel made us feel right at home. We will be back!!
Review 15,"I recently booked a room at this Hilton for just the day, as I was in town for business. The staff was so accommodating and friendly, both before and during the stay. They expected me by name and made me welcome. They were polite and helpful. The hotel was very nice, but I have to say I was most impressed with the hospitality of the staff. They were just outstanding!! I will definitely be recommending this hotel to everyone I know! I was raving about the hotel to everyone I knew as soon as I stepped out the door."
Review 16,"The Sherry is by far my most favorite hotel. My business takes me to New York often, and it's such a pleasure to always be spoiled rotten! From the flowers, chocolates, handwritten note of thanks from the manager, to porters bringing me some microwaved popcorn! This is old school service, I count the days for my next trip."
Review 17,"Good points ‚Äì 1. excellent location (1minute walk to Central Park; close to shopping areas and the Met); 2. Spacious room (in NYC standard) with comfy bed and soft beddings; 3. Complimentary refreshments in room, which is a nice touch of the hotel.
Bad points ‚Äì 1. The housekeeping staff took away one of my tops by mistake. People make mistakes sometimes so I was not too upset that it happened. I was unhappy as I had to explain the incident to the reception 3 times before someone actually acted upon it ‚Äì very disappointing given it is supposed to be a 5-star hotel. The receptionist told me that housekeeping could not find the top but then it was later returned to my room with no note of apologies or explanation; 2. Hotel staff in general was polite and professional but some of them (esp. lift attendants) were too stiff ‚Äì you just couldn‚Äôt have a chit chat with them ‚Äì not very friendly; 3. There was some cigarette smell lingering for a couple of days. When we rang the reception, they said it was the smell of the cleaning liquid. (really? Seriously? Are you kidding me?!!); 4. Bathroom is bit old and dated. Took 10mins before hot water would come thru every evening.
The hotel staff recommended a diner called Gene‚Äôs on the 60th ‚Äì absolute gem ‚Äì must try. The hotel also offered 15% off if dine in ‚ÄúBottega del Vino‚Äù next door. Please I beg you not to bother ‚Äì the food was ok but all the waiters were so up themselves and arrogant and rude, which made the whole dining experience pretty awful. 
Most of the guests at the hotel seemed rather miserable and took themselves too seriously, maybe this is why staff were not very laid back. Gotta loosen up, people. (just my personal opinion)"
Review 18,"My buddy and I stayed at the Best Western during the Final Four. It's a couple of blocks from downtown Houston. However, the location turned out to be ideal as mid-town is also a couple of blocks in a different direction and it has a terrific collection of bars and restaurants. Sonny who works at the front desk will be happy to drive you to any of them.
The free breakfast was outstanding.
Jo (who really runs the place) could not have been a better host and made sure that all of our needs were met. They probably don't pay her enough given that she goes out of her way to make sure the guests are happy.
Bottom line: the hotel met our needs"
Review 19,"I stood 4 nights at this hotel with my mother (shopping trip).
Before booking a room for four nights at the Best Western Downtown Inn and Suites, I read some reviews about this and other hotels on the downtown zone (Doubletree, Marriot Courtyard, etc.) and I'm glad to say that all of the good comments that were written about BW are true.
The hotel is located right oustide the Houston downtown, but outside doesn't mean far. The few times I decided to walk to the downtown, a 15-minutes walk took me to the heart of it. If you aren't a walkiing person, the shuttle of the hotel will take you anywhere within the downtown area or even to the midtown if the distance isn't too far. 
The rooms are clean, spacious and very well equipped with an iron, a coffee maker, the basic bathroom amenities, satellital TV and as many bottles of water as you can drink. It also has a microwave and a small fridge, which makes your stay even more comfortable. Vending machines are avaiable to get microwave food and sodas whenever you want.
The best of the hotel is the staff: Jo, the front-desk lady is just lovely and helpful. Sonny (the multi-task guy of the business) is always ready to give you a ride on the shuttle or to recommend you the hot spots to hang out at night. There is a third front-desk guy called Don, that kindly took us to a Walgreen's like 20 blocks away from the hotel in his own car, as the shuttle only works from Monday to Friday. That was something nice I didn't expect.
The breakfast is simple but effective: waffles, sweet bread, cereal, milk, coffee, eggs, sausages and bacon. They serve the same breakfast everyday, so try to ""rotate"" your choices if you are staying more than one night and you don't like to have the same everyday.
The hotel is totally non-smoking. If you are a nicotine addict, DON'T DO IT INSIDE the rooms. During our stay, we saw two guys being kindly kicked out of the hotel after paying a $ 250.00 fine for smoking inside.
The only thing I didn't like were the pillows. They were too large and squishy and it's the only kind of pillows they have, so if you are a ""firm"" pillows user like me, you will have to bring yours. 
In conclusion, if I ever visit Houston again, I will stay here for sure."
Review 20,"I love this simple hotel! Sparkling clean with extrodinarily comfortable beds tucked into spacious rooms. 
It clings to the outskirts of down town and offers free shuttles for the out and about. The staff is efficient and carrying...they fussed more than I did when I thought I lost my phone. 
 The entire hotel is a non-smoking oasis."
Review 21,"This was our second trip to the Sherry. We were there in October and again this month. The ambiance is Old World style as you are greeted by the doorman, the front desk staff and the ever so courteous elevator assistants. Our rooms overlooking Central Park South...couldn't be more better for ""city watching"". Shopping, dining and entertainment are steps away and being an Apple aficionado, having the flagship Apple store right next door couldn't get any better! The rooms are spacious and well appointed. Every request from room service to UPS delivery of an over-night package was handled with finesse. The Sherry will always be my favorite place to stay in New York!"
Review 22,"I brought my 84 year old mother to New York last week for a birthday treat of shopping, dining, etc. We absolutely loved our stay here, start to finish. The reservations agent, Miss Julie, was extremely pleasant & helpful. Our room was gorgeous, clean, fresh flowers & candy, and the bed was to die for ( I wanted to order one). They offer a 20% discount to those guests who choose to dine at Harry Cipriani's, a nice bonus. Of couse, the location of the Sherry Nethrland is excellent, close to great shopping & restaurants. This comes in handy in any kind of inclement weather.
The hiring process must be rigorous as every member of the staff we encountered was unfailingly courteous and professional. It was like walking back in time to the 'good old days' when people took their jobs seriously and wanted to provide guests truly excellent service.
We will be back, but perhaps I'll go there with my husband next time as it a cozy, romantic place too.

Review 23,"The hote is immaculate! Rooms are very clean and the beds are so comfortable with down comforters and pillows. Every morning, we were greeted with a delicious breakfast bar filled with scrambled eggs, sausage, bacon, waffles, bagels, fruit, coffee, juice, cold cereal, hot cereal, and more--it was wonderful! Plus, we had free bottled water available to us at all times and they have a happy hour at 5pm where we would start our evening with a few glasses of wine and snacks. The staff was personable and helpful. We especially got to know Sonny--he's the man to see when in Houston. He recommended 3 restaurants to us and they were all outstanding. I had the best steak I've ever had and Sonny pointed the way! He drove the shuttle van and took us where we need to go. Our other colleagues stayed at the Hilton, Hyatt, and Crowne Plaza. Little 'ole Best Western had them all beat!!! Our stay cost about 1/3 less and we had all the great perks!! One colleague commented that her bottled water was $3.50 at the Hilton. I cannot rave enough about this hotel. I will be returning to Houston for another conference in the future and will stay at the Best Western."
Review 24,"My wife and I went to NYC for our anniversary and stayed at the Sherry Netherland. 
The good...The location is outstanding (5th Ave and 59th Street across from the horse carriage stand at Central Park). Central to everything. The staff is excellent, attentive, polite, includign the white-gloved elevator operators.
The bad...The much-raved-about Cipriani's restaurant was poor at best. Breakfast was blindingly expensive. The food was sub-par. The wait staff was slow and inattentive.
The ugly...""Courtyard view"" ??? Really ??? Look at the attached photo and make up your own mind.
For the world-class price they charge, the Sherry Netherland needs to up their game to compete favorably against other world-class hotels."
Review 25,"It is a hotel experience like this that makes you want to visit New York. A perfect location, combined with expansive rooms, wonderful service, and a beautiful view of Central Park will bring us back again soon. A last minute dinner, arranged quickly and courteously by Cipriani next door, made it a perfect stay for us. k and b, Boston"
Review 26,"As long as you your dealings keep you west of the 610 loop, this is a great option - near the new City Centre complex, between routes 8 and 6, near the major oil companies, and surrounded by various dining options, though very limited entertainment or culture in the area. Very clean - new feel - ample parking (free) - and priced right. 
Highly recommend it."
Review 27,"There is a downside to Tripadvisor that shows its face occasionally - a self fulfilling prophecy, here's how it works.......................
An average hotel / service / (whatever) gets some good reviews and the Manager responds to the reviews with kind words to the reviewer and more follow, the hotel climbs the popularity ladder and then people start to choose it because its near the top. To get in on the 'love fest' action they then also write good reviews and get fawned on by the management etc etc etc even though its in relaity no better than other similar products.
Suprisingly the one ""I don't get it"" review gets no management response - so this perfectly adequate hotel becomes the 4th best in Houston - really ????? This is a sub-brand chain hotel in office central, how can that be ?
I have stayed here quite a few times as well as the Courtyard Marriot just across the way - I like the HGI slightly more, the Courtyard is marginally less nice overall but it is 194 in the ranking which would make this HGI just above that so here's and honest review of this hotel - stayed here 3 nights this week.
Check-in - friendly enough but nothing special no welcome back etc, interestingly some colleagues didn't get the free breakfast coupons that come with our company rate here - arguements ensued and end result they didn't get them apparently because they had booked through an agent ...........just as I had and received them - get it sorted guys !
Rooms - nice enough but a bit dated, really think these chains should have central air con, hate the noisy wall / window units
Cleanliness - had a good look round as others have waxed lyrical, clean enough I suppose but lots of corners not vacumed, same in bathroom so pretty average.
Bed - really like these adjustable ones
Toiletries replaced sometimes
Wireless - really slow in higher rooms, spoke to reception to see if anything could be done and the answer was its working ok
Food - absolutley average, really nothing great to write home about, usually choose to eat out for that reason
Breakfast - didn't bother to use my vouchers as last time cooked was very greasy so has put me off
Check-in staff general - always felt I was breaking in on some gossip as I passed and it went quiet a couple of times, no friendly hello's etc - pretty poor really.
So, all in all a really average hotel that thinks its one of the top ones in Houston and clearly isn't - can we have some more honest and realistic reviews on here please to stop this kind of thing from happening and maybe some consideration of what can actually be done better by management so they actually try."
Review 28,"Very clean, very comfortable, great price . . . I will stay there again for sure."
Review 29,"I had read the other reviews when selecting this hotel, but once I got there, I couldn't figure out what the big deal was. Sure, it was clean, and yes, it was quiet, but the food wasn't all that great. As far as toiletries go, just average. Service was fine. When they couldn't book me into the room I had requested, I received a free breakfast voucher. Overall, it was fine, but I wouldn't go out of my way to stay here and probably won't again."
Review 30,"Great location,great staff,amazing rooms and bathrooms, quiet with no noise at all, all in all brilliant. One of the best value rooms for location,service,comfort(the beds were excellent),service etc etc
Located just on 5th Avenue opposite Central park and a block away from the Apple store and FAO Swchartz , but very quiet. All of the staff were excellent and it really felt like a home from home. Small but nice touches included free soft drinks and water in the mini bar, with fresh flowers and chocolates.
A great stay and we will definitely return"
Review 31,"Good location close to Central park and in easy walking distance of most attractions. We were upgraded to a beautiful suite overlooking Central park,which helped to make our stay special.Warm welcome,friendly staff and good service. The only downside was the small lobby with no ""common area"" where you could easily get a drink or cup of coffee. The restaurant (Harry Cipriani's) which was attached to the hotel was a bit fromal and stuffy if you just wanted a cool drink,as we did in the recent heat wave- no shorts allowed,not even late afternoon before dining starts.Other than that, lovely stay."
Review 32,"Our stay at the Sherry (Sept. 17-20) was wonderful. The hotel is steps away from Central Park, FAO, and Bergdorffs. The staff is knowledgeable and friendly. Any request was immediately taken care of. The rooms are larger than the average NYC hotel. The restaurant and bar are well worth the visit. We felt as if we were a guest at a fabulous home instead of a hotel. Warm and welcoming! Stocked mini bar in the room and umbrellas for the rainy days.
The beds were very comfortable.
We will be back."
Review 33,"We were fortunate to have a beautiful suite on the 20th floor. Traditional in design, the room was very comfortable and luxurious. The service was excellent. I would definitely recommend it to others. This was a business trip for my husband and his partners, but the wives tagged along for the shopping and theatre! So it was business and pleasure."
Review 34,"The room was gorgeous, beautifully decorated, the service was excellent, the view from the window remarkable, the localization excellent. I do recommend staying at the Sherry Netherland Hotel if you go to New York."
Review 35,"I just got back from my Labor Day weekend at The Sherry and will go again in a heart-beat when the next special comes along. 
I like the challenge of finding 5-star deals on a budget. When I also manage to get the same exceptional service and attention as those who can easily afford such luxury, it's a very rare combination indeed. But the Sherry hit a home run on both counts and I think that I've found my special go-to place to stay. From the youngest to the oldest employee, from the early morning/late night front desk staff to every single elevator captain and bellop, ALL were unfailingly polite and cheerful! You really get the sense that they love their jobs and they are super happy to serve. Each time my mother and I came through the door, I felt as though we were truly welcomed ""home"". In fact, it got to be nothing to just hang out in the lobby and get the best tips on where to shop or get the best coffee and brunch. I am serious...this staff can give the top hotels in NYC some lessons in true hospitality.
Room 211, which I think was a wonderful upgrade on their part, is fit for any special occasion. Spacious, beautifully appointed with a big screen TV and a gazillion cable stations, a wonderful large bathroom, lots of light , and a birds-eye view of the CBS Early Show studio....not to mention a corner of the famous corner anchored by The Plaza Hotel. There were times when we just felt like ""staying put"", but we didn't miss out on the buzz of the city. It was right outside to see!
Want to get away quick? The subway stop is right around the corner of the hotel. You can be in Union Square (HUGE Filene's and Whole Foods Market) in less than 25-minutes. Feel like you need to commit to an East Side -vs-West Side experience? Don't bother. You can do both without much effort with cabs and cross-town buses all around -- not to mention horse drawn carriages. An escape to the more magical? Famous Central Park, which can seem postively other-worldly in the quiet morning sunlight, is steps aways.
When in NYC, we usually stay at The Casablanca, The Elysee, and The Lucerne. Each has a lot to recommend it. But I honestly have to say that I am going to take time to check out the Sherry first before I look elsewhere from now on. If you really want to kick your NYC experience up a notch, you should too. You'll be really glad that you did!"
Review 36,"With its wonderful location off Central Park, this very traditionally elegant hotel has a lot to offer. Be careful about room selection, the variation is greater than most hotels. Staff is efficient if slightly stiff. Pricey but probably worth it."
Review 37,"Amazing personal service, they make you feel right at home"
Review 38,"Hotels always good on their websites, but this hotel exceeded our expectations. 
1) Set back from the main road....it felt very private and peaceful.
2) Outdoor area/parking lot always very well lit
3) Clean...and I mean really clean....bathroom, linens, rugs, furnishings....immaculate for this very picky traveler. 
4) Beautiful lobby and decor......I even took pictures of it. Warm, welcoming, big fireplace...
5) Staff deserves 10 Gold Stars...everyone very kind, warm, helpful. Hilton better hold onto this group of stellar employees. 
6) Super hot (as in temp.) coffee....from convenient caraffes in the hall at 6 a.m during the week. (We were on 7th floor). Excellent coffee from the Buffet Breakfast. 
7) Fresh, tasty and convenient Buffet Breakfast....made to order omeletes, sausage, bacon, bisquits w/ gravey, fresh fruits. every kind of bread/muffin/toast you can imagine. Beautiful dining area. 
8) Free Shuttle........Vallerie helped me out in a pinch and drove me to my designation (and picked me up) with a simple phone call. 
9) Pantry Pavillion....24/7 pantry if you need any last minute items (I needed pistachios and chocolate). 
10) Fresh baked and wrapped cookies for guests. 
11) Large desk area w/ perfect Internet connection."
Review 39,"This was our family's 4th stay at The Sherry-Netherland. We absolutely love it. Perfect location, updated rooms, great beds, incredibly clean, marble finishes in the bathrooms, flatscreen TVs, tons of bathroom amenities, etc. Our kids are made to feel welcome, each received a personalized gift bag with goodies inside. These are the little things that show the staff really cares. I can't praise this hotel and its staff enough. We will be back."
Review 40,"Went there for our 10th wedding anniversary and were completely taken aback by the staff and hotel. I've never in my life seen such quality service. You are made to feel as if you own the whole hotel. Everywhere you go, you are greeted with smiles and friendly comments. If you want a truly amazing experience and many wonderful memories and are going to NYC, put this hotel at the top of your list. Thank you to all the staff @ the Sherry ...there are too many of you to name specifically, but you were all awesome !! We'll be back ASAP."
Review 41,"Wow-I really enjoyed this Hilton Garden Inn because the rooms, bar, food, and service was impeccable. LaLa was a big help and provided excellent customer service. This was another business trip for me and I would recommend it to any business traveller or vacationer."
Review 42,"Handy for Westlake with very friendly pick-up service from Westlake. For those without hire car, the hotel has a bar and restaurant serving nice food."
Review 43,"Brought two soccer teams here to stay for the weekend for a tournament. The hotel staff was outstanding from minute one and never once dropped the ball. Had stayed here once before and had a good experience so chose this hotel again for that reason. The property is beautiful, kept immaculately clean and very well appointed. The staff is outstanding and the level of service is better than many larger or competitor properties that I have stayed in. Rooms are comfortable, have microwaves, refrigerators and coffee in the rooms. Nice fitness center and even a guest laundry. Good location and easy access to the highway and the businesses in the area. I will stay here again and again anytime I am in the area."
Review 44,"I was greeted at the front desk by a sweet woman named La-La. In fact she spoke to me each time I passed through after checking in! I was very impressed with the cleanliness and comfort of my room and bathroom. 
The breakfast ranks up there with some of the top hotel breakfasts I've ever eaten. So many selections! I selected your hotel for 4 reasons: Location, price, trip-advisor reviews and responses from your general manager. 
I wish I had another excuse to visit Houston so I could stay here again!"
Review 45,"I had a very nice stay at the hotel. The room and service were exceptional. The staff are all very pleasant and helpful. The hotel is well maintained, clean and comfortable. I will certainly be back and I recommend to others."
Review 46,"Relatively new, good fitness center, excellent staff, very nice lobby, nice little pool with a neat little waterfall, clean and very comfortable room, good desk, good internet access (surprisingly good for a hotel!) Everything worked!"
Review 47,"The staff made my weekly stays at the hotel for the past 6 months so enjoyable. I always felt at home and very comfortable there. They did an amazing job at making me feel very welcome. My company decided to put me and a few of my coworkers up in a nearby apartment complex to cut down on costs, but I will definitely miss staying at HGI, and of course the rubber duckies that always greeted me when I got to my room."
Review 48,"We held the Annual Meeting for our organization at Hilton Garden Inn - Houston Energy Corridor last week. I'm new to setting up meetings and don't know what I'm doing yet. To a person, the people at this HGI are simply outstanding! Marcia Burt is the Sales Director and helped me to cover the things I forgot. Jennifer Dennis is Catering Manager and she helped me pick out all of the meals, lined up all of the AV stuff, and all of the details.
And then there's Marco... I think Marco's title must be ""Mr. Everything Else"". You will rarely find a person with such a 'can-do' attitude. He set up the sound system and projectors. He ran the kitchen and made sure that the meals were on time. The food that came out of that small kitchen was just OUTSTANDING! I fouled up a few things, but never managed to stump him. He took it all in stride and helped to make our meeting a great success. All of his people were great too! Always around, solicitous, but unobtrusive.
Thanks Guys! But I'm afraid you've fouled us up in one way... From now on when I go to a hotel to set up a meeting, my expectations are going to be way too high!"
Review 49,"A GLOWING REVIEW: Hilton Garden Inn, Energy Corridor.....AMAZING!!!! From the moment I stepped into the hotel, greeted by Debbie Bunn, it was a wonderful experience! ALL the family and friends stayed at the hotel. The Rehearsal Dinner and Cocktail Hour before were perfection! YIPPPEEEE! A business that KNOWS their business and does it to....yep! Perfection!!!! More to say about the Hilton Garden Inn......I delivered 22 baskets to the hotel on Wednesday before the wedding. Family and friends began arriving on Thursday and would arrive all the way through to Saturday afternoon. Each and every person received their basket at check-in AND received the correct basket. (Each basket was made for each family in mind.) We're off to a great start! Then, following my dad's birthday celebration at Texas Land and Cattle (already heard that story, did ya?).....we all went back to the hotel and we took over the bar area, stayed around past the time the bar was to close and the bartender told us...no problem! No Problem....I'm sorry, I am just not used to that selfless, customer service oriented behavior....AMAZING!!!!! 
Friday....family and friends still arriving...hotel handling everything smoothly. Shuttle took family and friends to the mall and picked them up again....and was prompt! I arrived at 3:00 to begin decorating the hall. Jennifer is the event planner for the hotel. Another ""Can Do"" person. How could there possibly be that many GOOD people in one place? The room was set up, Marco was there to run everywhere around the hotel for me, finding everything that I requested....HE should be the CEO of Hilton! That guy is over the top! The room was super fun with all the Texas decorations, and the details were all taken care of by Jennifer, Marco and the hotel staff. The cocktail hour was a hit and the appetizers were excellent! They even set up our own little bar! The Barbeque and all the fixins' were superb! People were still talking about it on Saturday! We finally ""let"" Marco and the waitstaff go home about 10:30. They never complained! Just said it was a wonderful event! THE ENTIRE NIGHT AMAZING!!!! THEY WERE AMAZING!!! Once again, we all stayed at the hotel bar area and the lounge area for a while longer. Did the bartender complain? Nope! Sure didn't! What is this hotel feeding its staff? Happiness, Loyalty, Appreciation? Maybe....just maybe.....what a novel idea! Saturday night....Wedding is over, all is well at the hotel. Everyone is resting, including my hubby and myself. They comped us a room for Friday and Saturday night, so if we wanted to be with family, we could. Really? Giving us something for nothing....noooooo way! WAY!!!!!!! We got up on Sunday morning, met everyone for breakfast. They gave us the back area, so that we could all be together and then we all broke bread together as family. It was a wonderful ending to a wonderful weekend. I truly am almost in tears thinking about and writing about ""our"" wonderful hotel. They joined my family that weekend. They were as happy and excited for us, as we were. From the bottom of my heart, I thank you Hilton. God's blessings upon each and everyone of you, and much, much success always. YOU DESERVE IT!!!!"
Review 50,"We have been planning for this trip a long time, first time for my children to to New York!!, I have three boys, ages 7, 11, and 14, picking them up from Camp in upstate New York. We stayed for 13 nights!! can you imagine?
Where do I start........everything was truly exceptional, the rooms that we where assigned to...perfect one bedroom suite with a sofa bed on the other room, a kitchenette that saved us a bunch of expenses by having cereal or a sandwich now and then, and also feeling like residents a bit. In front of our suite, a room for my other two boys, also perfect, the decoration, very clean and luxurious..........and the beds are the most cozy and confortable beds we have ever experienced in any hotel, and we have been all over the world. The staff, how we felt welcomed with gifts for our kids, sodas and water for free every day and the amazing service worth mentioning Tammy at the front desk, she is the best!! and Kristina Kinet, Thank you for everything!!!"
Review 51,"I had the pleasure of staying at the Sherry-Netherland for one night only which was such a shame as it is brilliant.
On my arrival I was ever so nicely greeted and looked after by the front desk. 
My room was 1111 and I can honestly say that when I entered it my jaw hit the floor. It is massive. The lounge is big and can certainly be used to host a drink reception. There is a kitchen area, small but does the job.
The bedroom was big as well and the bed ................ one of the most comfortable I have ever slept on, especially the pillows. As soft as anything.
The location is great on 5th Avenue, at the south end of Central Park and north end of the shops. 
Would I stay there again . Absolutely."
Review 52,"This is the way it must have been for my mom in New York City in the '50's...like visiting your dowager aunt living quietly in elegance on the Upper East Side. Today, it's mostly a residence with fifty or so rooms available. Ours was a suite on the tenth floor, loads of space, a deco bathroom, a kitchenette filled with complimentary soft drinks (a lovely touch)...my daughter left a note saying ""I (loveheart) this hotel"" which just about sums up our visit. A particular pleasure was our interchanges with the elevator operators...of course we could have pushed the buttons ourselves, but how enjoyable to have a real person watching out for you. We also loved the back entrance to Cipriani's...we felt very sophisticated sitting at the four seat bar having a Martini (ask for a ""Hemingway""). The Sherry isn't the newest or coolest midtown hotel, but it continues to deliver an elegance of another time...an experience you'll surely enjoy."
Review 53,"We have been coming to New York City since I was a little boy, and I know all of the finest hotels in the city very well. I am now in my sixties, and there is no other hotel I would stay at in the city besides the Sherry. The rooms are beautiful, the location is the best, the staff is genuinely caring, they are like a family. And it is truly a value, not a rip-off like most other hotels in the city."
Review 54,"I have been to midtown Manhattan many times and have stayed in a variety of hotels. This place has been the best. Nice, quiet hotel near Central Park...not noisy like the hotels near Times Square. Never had to wait for an elevator. The place has white gloved elevator operators! Rooms are nice and big and super clean. Right across the street from the Plaza if you are in the mood for some drinks. Within walking distance of everything. Will stay here again...just loved it!"
Review 55,"Took my wife to NYC for her 50th b-day. The hotel is beautiful inside and the decor in rooms etc. made us feel as if we went back in time to the early 1900's but with modern amenities. Very ornate lobby and elevators (real live elevator operators) Great location at Central Park and within a 10 to 15 minute walk to Time Square and Broadway shows. We have stayed near Time Square in the past but wanted something less crazy and this place met our expectations. Also a short walk to Metropolitan Museum and You can pick up hop on hop off sightseeing buses, take carriage ride a block away from hotel. So for us it was convenient near attractions and less hectic than other parts of the city. We got a great price break and paid for three nights and got third for free. It is hard to find an inexpensive luxury hotel in this area. This hotel also has upscale residences in it."
Review 56,"The Sherry-Netherland is most definitely a very unique and exceptional hotel. While I was staying there, I felt as if I were staying in an elegant pre-war Fifth Avenue co-op apartment. The old-world elegance and the attention to the details of hospitality (a hand-written welcome note from the manager, fresh flowers, a box of lovely chocolates, gratis beverages in the refrigerator, and white-gloved elevator operators) make The Sherry-Netherland a breath of fresh air in today's cookie-cutter world of sameness and mediocrity. The Sherry-Netherland is heads and shoulders above its competition! Kudos to the exceptional staff---especially Renee and Russell. I look forword to my next stay at The Sherry!"
Review 57,We had a/c problems this past weekend so decided to stay here to get away from the heat and leaking problems! It was wonderful from start to finish! LaLa at the front was very nice and made sure our evening was a good one! We used the pool and hot tub and enjoyed it. Was nice to destress a little from the problems back at the house. We had a quiet night's rest. The hotel is very warm and inviting from the staff to the rooms! Definitely recommend to anyone coming to the area! Thanks!
Review 58,"My husband and I had our wedding there May 7th and I want to thank the staff, specially the Wedding Coordinator and catering manager Ms. Dennis and Mr. Marco, Food and Beverage Hotel Mngr. for going always ahead of us to please our needs. 
Every detail for the big day was done perfect, the timing for everything planned the food WOW delicious, guests were amazed at the food and service while they waited with appetizers and drinks. Once the party started and dinner was served everyone was even more thrilled to see the different choices in the buffet line, set up with so many choices of fresh and luscious foods. 
Our decorations were so elegant, and all the details I myself wanted such as little surprises through the night, or the way I wanted things to look, colors, chair covers, cake table, gift table, favors for guests, announcements, even our picture and sign table etc‚Ä¶ where done exactly as I had asked them. Having our wedding there was hassle free and with less planning from our part. 
Everyone at the hotel was so friendly and we look forward to spending our next anniversary there as we can assure the next morning‚Äôs breakfast after our wedding reception was so DELICOUS we didn‚Äôt want to leave. 
As for the hotel itself, it is beautiful, it smells still like new, the rooms are comfortable, the bathrooms close to the wedding reception were kept neat and clean, and the floors and decorations were so nice and pleasant to invite anyone to stay there. We also want to mention the nice appearance of the front staff and the waitress/clean crew for looking clean and professional. 
Finally, we will keep staying at the Hilton family and would like to say one more time thanks to the Hilton Garden Inn for making it possible to have our dream wedding come true!!!
Love Diana and Marvin Gonzalez"
Review 59,Rooms were large and beautifully decorated!! Staff was helpful & friendly. Very comfortable bed!!
Review 60,This hotel is absolutely beautiful. We have stayed here a few times now and we really don't ever want to stay anywhere else when we visit NYC. We have stayed in suites and rooms and even the rooms are very large. You can't beat a suite! No two are the same and they are all HUGE! The hotel is very quiet. We hardly ever see another person and we definitely don't hear a thing. The staff go out of there way to greet you and make sure that you have everything that you need. I can't imagine a nicer hotel in NYC. I HIGHLY recommend the Sherry Netherland!!
Review 61,"Location is perfect, but not all the rooms are fine. The first day we were on a room on the 3rd floor with an ugly interior view, no hot water, and they were not able to change the room till the next day,we had an interior regular view on the 10th floor, and everything was ok, nice amenities and free soft drinks on the fridge. Bad wi fi signal on both rooms.
Jummeirah essex house is a much better option with same location and very similar prices."
Review 62,"Not only is this property in a great, central location, but it's a beautiful hotel as well! The banquet team can't be beat - everything was set up perfectly and were happy to help with last minute preparations. The catering was exceptional also. Extremely accommodating! We will be hosting our future seminars here!"
Review 63,"I have stayed at this hotel numerous times in Houston when I come to town to visit my clients in the Energy Corridor. I love the convenient location and the staff are great too. I've stayed at countless Hilton properties and this one is one of my go-to's and favorites. This hotel is a gem in the HGI crown!
Let me count the ways I love this place: 
- (Insert oil company name here) is just minutes away! 
- There's a Kinko's next door! 
- I don't have to get on the freeway to get to my meetings! 
- There are tons of restaurant options nearby (sushi, Mexican, BBQ, etc)!
- I am always greeted as a return customer, and they've upgraded my rooms a few times!
This hotel has great hospitality and I think it is a no brainer if you're going here for business. The staff are great and know what they are doing. 
One tip though - book well in advance, because this HGI's awesomeness is known around town to energy corridor business travelers, this HGI is often booked to capacity. I've had to pull the Hilton strings more than once to make a reservation when they've appeared to be sold out. Now you have a tip to outsmart everyone to get your room here, too."
Review 64,"Our son and new daughter in law had their wedding reception here. It not only met expectations, but exceeded our expectations. The event planner and restaurant manager were on site for the entire event making sure everything ran smoothly. There was plenty of waitstaff, the food was amazing and the event was truly magical. Truly lived up to the Hilton name."
Review 65,"We booked here because they were able to offer connecting rooms and the location was good for visiting family. We arrived at 10pm and there were no connecting rooms, (we could have called ahead to confirm but did not). The front desk staff worked together to come up with a plan to accommodate our family and after the first night we switched one of the rooms which worked fine. They were so polite and helpful. In fact, EVERYONE working at the hotel was unbelievably hospitable....a very well trained staff! Price seemed low coming from Calif but we found out that other similar hotels in the area were less expensive. Still, no complaints. Rooms were quiet, large, comfortable and clean and staff was amazing so it was money well spent!"
Review 66,"In for yet another soccer tournament. We really enjoyed our stay. Everything was so clean and neat. There was a warm smell of cookies or vanilla in the lobby that made it feel welcoming. Our room was spacious, and the beds were very comfortable. The front desk staff was friendly and accommodating. I highly recommend this hotel. Conveniently located just off of I-10."
Review 67,"We selected this hotel over hotels closer to Houston because of its high rating in Trip Advisor. I was a little disappointed and wish I had gone with a hotel closer to the city. It's not that it's a bad hotel, it isn't. It just donesn't deserve being the #6 best hotel in Houston. From my standards, it's a very good hotel, just what you would expect from a Hampton or a Garden Inn, but it's not an outstanding hotel.
On the downside, the service is spotty. Some staff are increadibly helpful while others are not. For example, wanting a cup of coffee around 3 pm on a Sunday afternoon we discovered it was cold. When we told the front desk about it, their reply was that we would have to wait a couple of hours until the new shift came on duty. What?! Room service was also slow on some days. We had to wait until 5:30 pm on a Sunday to get a maid to make up our room.
On the upside, the breakfast is very nice at a cost of $10 per person. There are cookies in the lobby in the afternoon. The wireless Internet and parking is free. The exercise room is minimal but acceptable. The rooms were clean, comfortable, and quiet which is what is more important than a hot cup of coffee on a Sunday afternoon."
Review 68,Stay frequently for business. The staff goes out of their way to make sure you are well looked after. My home away from home.
Review 69,"The staff is always focused on taking care of it's clients. We had a meeting at this location for two days and the food was better than anticipated.
I'm sure we will be back in the near future!!"
Review 70,I just want to say that the staff was very helpful in getting my family an early check-in for a local wedding. Kelly was particularly helpful and I want to thank her very much!
Review 71,Service is excellent!!! it's the most important thing to me. Kudos to all the staffs... you guys are doing great job. You can't go wrong with the location - trust me. Room is great and the television is BIG! I didn't have to press any button in the elevator coz they'll do it for you - and they know what your floor is! I can't ask for more...
Review 72,"luckily we got an amazing rate for this POSH hotel...almost half the usual price. luxurious landmark hotel right across the street from the park (central park, that is). and everything in the room fridge is complimentary! gotta love that. if you want to do something special, and can't afford the plaza, this is the answer!"
Review 73,"The Sherry Netherland functions so smoothly it could almost put you to sleep. This is not neccessary a good or bad thing. That will depend on whether you're looking for excitement, or predicability.
My wife and I like both equally, both can't afford the grand a night it costs. For us there is the Sherry Netherland. Perfectly located; historical, friendly, intimate, cumfy, and quiet. Five stars all around, but especially for value!"
Review 74,"It's not the typical hotel with a big lobby. However if you want a quiet but upscale hotel this is it. You are welcome from the minute you step in until you leave. The staff pro guest ratio is very low so I never waited in line for any service. The staff were very friendly with my kids. Location was perfect as it was in a safe area to walk around, food choices are aplenty in the area. Beside subway and bus stops. Service was impeccable"
Review 75,"If you like old world charm and the best location in NYC, this is the hotel for you. Situated in New York's most outstanding street corner, the hotel offers great rooms, a coziness that only an hotel with 50 rooms can provide, a staff that greets you with a smile and an atmosphere similar to New York's top tier hotels. Prices are reasonable for New York's standards and rooms are big, very well decorated and with all the amenities that you' d expect from a five star hotel. The only problem was the noise from the courtyard, because of the air conditioning units that work all day and night. A second minor problem is that you have to wait a couple minutes for the hot water in the shower, because - I suppose - plumbing is tired. But besides that, I recommend this hotel to those who would like to stay confortably in New York's best address and in a landmark building that has been kept in pristine condition."
Review 76,"La camera √® una standard americana, ovvero sempre troppo grande per una persona sola ma comunque pulita. Nei bonus era compresa la colazione e un servizio di aperitivo che credo sia stata una delle cose pi√π povere e tristi che abbia ricevuto. L'hotel per√≤ si trova in una posizione comoda da raggiungere ma i dintorni non sono il massimo per fare una passeggiata. Nei dintorni infatti ci sono case abbandonate e semi distrutte, un carcere minorile (!!) , due cimiteri e campi abbandonati con carrelli della spesa ovunque..
tutto sommato √® ok per il prezzo se ci volete stare una notte.."
Review 77,"As always, making my reservation took less than 3 minutes using the Hilton website.
The hotel is located just off a major freeway/frontage road. The hotel offers plenty of convenient and free parking. I was greeted with a smile, welcomed by name, and my check-in took less than a minute. The hotel itself is very clean and well-maintained. The hotel caters to business travelers and at least in the early evening the lobby/bar area is fairly noisy. My room was on the sixth floor and was also very clean, with a spotless duvet and a very comfortable bed.
I am a long-time Hilton Diamond HHonors member, and virtually all of my domestic hotel stays are at HGI properties for reasons (as in this case) include: free and convenient parking, free high-speed internet, a free and well-equipped business center, a clean indoor pool and a free and well-equipped fitness center, and a restaurant offering good food at reasonable prices.
If you like to workout, I recommend that you get to the fitness center as early as you can because the place fills up fast. 
The property, its staff, my room, and all of the usual HGI amenities made for a very comfortable and enjoyable stay. I recommend this property to you."
Review 78,"Best location on the park, amazing views, staff lovely, made me feel welcome, rooms are airy light and beautifully appointed.
I spend only 2 days here before moving on to another place to stay. Great start to my New York visit, excellent breakfast and room service.
Thank you to everyone at the Sherry!"
Review 79,"stayed at the sherry for 3 nights whilst in new york, which is one of my favourite cities in the world. the staff there are the best thing about it.... warm and helpful, but never intruding. the rooms are beautifully appointed without trying too hard, with a botanical theme. because i'm not fond of large impersonal lobbies, i was really pleased arriving at the sherry despite the bustle outside its entrance. it felt like SUCH a privilege every time i walked through that revolving door. although i would have preferred a slightly quieter address further into the upper east side, there is something to be said for its proximity to bergdorf goodman :P 
although we didn't make use of the room service, i believe many good things have been said about its neighbour Harry cipriani. i'm always charmed by any establishment that offers free drinks in its minibar - whilst not the type to drink many of them in the first place, it just seems so much less 'commercial' this way... honestly, who's going to drink 20 cans of coke from the minibar, even if they were free? 
so... the sherry might suit someone like me, who prefers their hotels thoughtful, beautiful and intimate."
Review 80,"What a superb place to stay in NYC! Gorgeous rooms, friendly and helpful staff, perfect location. Totally delightful."
Review 81,"OK, so most of us can‚Äôt afford to be upper east-siders. But we can stay at the Sherry to see what the big deal is. And, it is a big deal. Walking distance to Broadway, the Lincoln Center and the main art museums. (don‚Äôt miss the Whitney!), as well as the many wonderful restaurants. Then, the hotel itself is no hotel. It is a residence. The staff is as professional as they come. We stayed for several days and lost the feeling of being yokels from Virginia because we were treated as residents. The rooms are exquisitely appointed and larger than the NYC norm. Cipriani‚Äôs is the attached restaurant and has great service and excellent food, which came with a discount, since we were residents ‚Ä¶ er ‚Ä¶ hotel guests. We try to get to the Apple at least once a year and traditionally select the Sherry. Occasionally we experiment with other venues such as the Plaza. But we have always happily returned to ‚Äúour‚Äù place. The Sherry. We‚Äôd give it six stars, if we could."
Review 82,"This is a nice hotel with friendly staff. Not luxurious, but comfortable. The ""king size"" bed is a small king, so plan accordingly. It has nice little touches to make the rooms homey - little reflective paint under counter in bathroom so turning on the light at night is unnecessary; shelving in the tub to hold towels; hutch for microwave and refrigerator with room for storage. We ate the breakfast and it was good - not great, but as it was included in our price, we won't complain. Sausage gravy and biscuits, eggs, bacon, cereals, fresh fruits, pastries, yogurt, french toast, pancakes, hash browns, coffee, juice, and am probably leaving something out. We received a special rate due to the meet we were attending and it included breakfast. Not sure we would have been as pleased otherwise, but for the $80 (including tax) we paid, it was beyond great."
Review 83,I went to all the hotels in the area to find the one that would accommodate my extended family and friends for my daughters wedding and this hotel was by far the best. It was everything they promised it would be and more. I would highly recommend having a weekend wedding in this hotel because the staff was very attentive and worked with our time crunch because it was a morning wedding. The hotel was set back off the freeway and it did not have a through street so I felt safe and secure.
Review 84,"Everything to say has already been said. Great staff, clean rooms, and very comfortable beds. So, I'd light to highlight great customer service from Lala. Every time I make a reservation to any hotel, I request non feather bedding because of my allergies. I simply cannot deal with donald or daffy. And every single time, the hotels over look this request. Lala read the request and personally checked the room as I unloaded the car to make sure that the geese were elsewhere. That's service people! Hotels with far more stars don't have that kind of accountability and person touch. I have no quarms about recommending this place.
GPS totally missed this place so be sure to be on the side of katy freeway heading east toward the beltway. Its next to texas land and cattle and holiday inn. The sign is small and low to the ground."
Review 85,"We stayed here one night to test drive the heavenly bed and not only the bed but everything about the stay was just right. Check in was cheerful, efficient and included a brief but thorough orientation, the room was tasteful and fresh, the bathroom and particularly the large shower ith double head was luxurious. And the bed....let's just say we ordered one yesterday to replace our much-hated tempurpedic. The location is very convenient to the huge medical complex and shopping mall, connected by a skyway. This was a very nice stay. Weekend rates are very reasonable."
Review 86,"This was my second stay at this property and it did not disappoint. The location is great for me with access via walkway to the Mall and several restaurants.
The rooms are clean and modernish in a Westin kind of way.
I have a pet peeve with all Westin's I hate the soap, other than that hard to find fault with the toiletries.
I did have one not so good experience; after being out for the day I cam back to find my room door adjar. When the room had been cleaned the door did not click shut, thus my possessions were unprotected for the day. Fortunately nothing was stolen but it could have been disastrous. (my computer was in the room)
There is also an unpleasant odour in the lobby, something that I have noticed on both occassions when I have been there.
Having said that the staff are great, very friendly and helpful and the rooms are very nice. Highly recommended."
Review 87,"I have been staying at the San Carlos Hotel probably for nearly a decade every time I am in NYC. I make 6-8 trips a year for either business or pleasure and my stays have ranged from a week to just a few nights. I was there the week before Christmas this time along with several business associates. 
Everything about this place is first class. The rooms are spacious as well as extremely clean and comfortable. The staff is enormously friendly and accommodating, courteous and fun. During what is a very hectic time in the City, the staff continued their excellent service, and the prices were entirely reasonable. The location, in midtown East is ideal, near to metro service and within easy walking distance of lots of excellent restaurants, diners, and attractions.
In addition to the warmth of the staff, the San Carlos did a great job this year of getting us all into the holiday spirit with their tasteful and clearly upscale decorations throughout the lobby and waiting areas. Whoever was responsible deserves special kudos. I commend the managment and staff for continuing to provide always such a hospitable place in a sometimes cold city!"
Review 88,I spent the weekend at the hotel and the service was perfect. The room was great and the staff was awesome as always. This is my favorite hotel in New York.
Review 89,"If I were to run a hotel, I'd do it the way it's done by the staff of The Sherry-Netherland. I'd been told by a friend of the superior staff, rooms, service, historical ambiance, still I knew there was no such place left in the U.S. Boy, was I wrong. 
The building is comprised mainly of apartments, lending it an air of quiet elegance, not at all dreary like some historic hotels. It faces the SE corner of Central Park, convenient for shopping and hopping on local transportation. The rooms are cheerful and immaculate, tastefully appointed with modern conveniences. As a side note, the park was too icy to run in during my stay; I discovered the Sherry has one of the best fitness rooms I've ever visited at a hotel!
Prices are steep, but what isn't in the city? I can't wait to be able to come back to The Sherry!"
Review 90,"The Westin Memorial City opened in the spring 2011, a midrise hotel with garage parking at I-10 and Gessner at Memorial City, the hospital campus/retail area. I stayed on business for two nights and was upgraded to a corner suite which provided a private bedroom with windows on 2 sides, the size of most hotel rooms; a Vegas-sized 12x12 bathroom with separate shower and non-jacuzzi :( tub, and sitting area with separate TV, sofa, table, bar and bathroom. Very roomy. Check-in was very professional and friendly. 
This is a property worthy of the best reputation Westin stands for. Nicely appointed, beautifully-finished, businesslike, with a very smart and professional staff.
Dinner both nights were from the on-site restaurant, Trattoria Il Mulino. Very good entrees, and my selections were non-traditional, did not disappoint, and were reasonably-priced. 
I did not rate the hotel as an excellent 'value' since it's well over $200/night so they're not giving it away. But it's fairly priced.
Let's talk about the road noise. There are 15 lanes of Interstate, 7 lanes of eastbound access road, and 11 lanes of Gessner Rd. including an underpass echo-chamber impacting this property. That corner-suite upgrade put me on the corner that put me front and center to ALL of those lanes and the drone of road noise all day and all night was much louder than I would have liked."
Review 91,"Excellent new property, stayed there approximately 20 days this year on business. Top notch. Great addition to the Starwood family.
- squeaky clean rooms
- huge bathrooms and spa showers, luxurious materials
- great staff
- great gym
- fancy rooftop outdoor pool; while haven't had the chance to try it, provided for great scenery while stretching after my workout"
Review 92,Stayed at the Westin for a week‚Äôs business in the area. Having stayed at many hotels I would rate this particular hotel right at the top. Clean & large room with a comfy bed was one of the many plus points. Good sized gym & handy little skywalk thru to the shopping mall also made for a pleasant stay.
Review 93,"San Carlos is a find. Located in a quiet neighborhood convenient to Grand Central and subway. Wonderful diner across the street. The staff is well trained and strives to please. Our suite was roomy and comfortable. Only complaint, the free breakfast pastry dry and would like fresh fruit."
Review 94,"We stayed in one of the suite rooms with 2 Queen beds and a Queen sofa bed in a separate room (4 people - 2 adults and 2 teens). We were surprised by the size of the bedroom and the additional room with the sofa bed. Everything was really nice - the bathrooms, the beds, and the kitchenette. There were nice bathroom fixtures and also a good size countertop space in the bathroom for us to share. We asked for a quiet room and got one - you would have never known you were in New York from the lack of street sounds - our room was completely quiet. We were impressed with the staff - when we asked for extra blankets and towels, they were immediately brought to our room. The staff was also helpful with restaurant suggestions. All in all, we could not have asked for more. This is a great hotel in a great spot in the city - blocks from Rockefeller Center and many other attractions and activities. We loved it and will definitely go back!"
Review 95,My family absolutely enjoyed our stay at San Carlos. Cleanliness was supreme and the one bedroom suite was spacious. The mini kitchenette was fabulous especially traveling with an infant and a child who has food allergies. We will be staying there again next year for our December trip.
Review 96,"My new favorite hotel in New York. Will definitely stay there again. Hotels in New York are outrageously priced during the Christmas season. The San Carlos was a bargain. It is older, but nicely furnished. Similiar to a Marriott. Free breakfast in the morning(fresh pastries and bagels, yogurt), refrigerator in room, free wifi, business center and Aveda products in the bathroom. Beds were nice and comfortable and the room was much larger than ones at the W on Lexington. Nice diner across the street for quick meals; breakfast and afternoon snacks. Right near the Waldorf for drinks and easy subway access. Bellman made limo reservations for us to take us to and from the airport; otherwise 2 cabs were needed. Arranged a car service for us at night. Suites were $100 per night higher and had a full living room and kitchenette. Plenty of places nearby to get a drink. Staff was friendly and helpful. Have stayed at the Omni Berkshire and the Kimberly in the past which have more ambience but cost a lot more. Will stay here in the future for the price. Another reviewer complained about the poor lighting, plumbing rattle, view of wall and inadequate breakfast. Yes the backside faces a wall about 25 feet away but you don't hear the horns blasting away in the morning on 50th. If he paid more, he could have had a room that faced the street. The bathroom is small but adequate and no plumbing rattle. Breakfast is better than Hampton Inn or Courtyard, and it is free in NYC. My lighting was fine, not inadequate. If you want luxury, stay across the street at the Benjamin or the New York Palace. This is a nice hotel, just not a fabulous hotel."
Review 97,"My daughter and I spent last weekend at The Sherry-Netherland, and were immediately impressed with the warm welcome at the front desk and the handwritten welcome note in our room. The staff made us feel at home, from the elevator operators who knew our floor, to the doormen who always greeted us so graciously. Our suite was lovely, appointed with beautiful furnishings in soft colors, and the bedding was so comfortable, it was like sleeping on a cloud! The location of the hotel could not be better, right on Fifth Ave at
59th St, overlooking the main entrance to Central Park. The highly acclaimed restaurant, Harry Cipriani, is there to be enjoyed by hotel guests as well as New Yorkers in the know.

Review 98,"I attended a convention a business conference at this hotel! The beds were really comfortable and luxorious. You even get a choice of feather or foam pillows! I brought the whole family and they certainly enjoyed themselves while I sat in class all day.The pool area is beautiful and overlooks the downtown area. We felt like we were in a resort! The hotel staff was friendly and accomodating. They extended a lovely friendly Texas Welcome to us. They were very pleasant whenever we called to ask for more towels or general directions. There is a skywalk that connects to the hotel, so you don't need to go outside to get to the mall. The mall is complete with a carousel for the little ones, a movie theater, and even an ice rink for the adventurous ones! There is a wide array of restaurants for every taste palette out there."
Review 99,"I'm a business traveler; I travel every week on business. Curious about this new Westin, I decided to try it. The room itself--wonderful, especially the bed, of course. Standalone shower is wonderful. Not much counter in the bath for us ladies with blowdryers and curling irons, but here's a frequent traveler tip: need more counter space? Use the ironing board. Anyway, bathroom nice and bright. Room very nice. 
Only disappointment was the staff....I always get a king bed room,and that's what I reserved, but they gave me a room with 2 doubles. ? So as soon as I stepped in the room and saw the beds, I called the front desk. The first guy to answer the phone says, Oooh, I dunno, we're full tonite. (HARDLY! The parking garage was mostly empty, the hallways and lobby deserted, come on. No need for bs like that.) He transfers me to the front desk who tell me, well, we'll see if we have any king bed rooms....WHAT? EXCUSE ME, but I booked a king bed room, I'm on your frequent stayer (Starwood ) program, the hotel is half empty! So now I raise the tone of my voice just a tad and say, Pardon me, I booked a king room, I expect a king room. {Geez it's not like I booked on hotline or something...I booked thru the hotel website!) Finally they come up with a king bed room. At that point things get better...they bring me the key and the rest of the stay is uneventful.
The only other issue is, don't park on level 4 of the garage, because the hotel elevator only goes to level 3. So if you are parked on 4, like I was, you will now have to trudge around the actual driveways of the garage up to level 4. That's insane, but oh well. 
I won't stay again. Too overpriced, inconvenient (garage thing), and staff too green for road warriors."
Review 100,This is a new Westin Property ... liked its location right next to a mall ... memorial city with lots of shops and restaurants. Hotel is right next to the highway .. making getting to the airport easy and also to other locations ... short 15 min drive to the Galleria Area ... Rooms are comfortable ... except highway can be a little noisy during peak times
Review 101,"I love staying at Westin's and this was a good stay. This is not an excellent place for Platinum recognition, but the stay was very good.
The hotel is new and everything works. As with all Westin's that I have been in, the bed was excellent and the shower was superb. The bathroom lighting was very nice. I got a room that was on the diagonal end, so my bath was very long -- that was a nice touch.
I had to pay for parking, so was not happy about that.
Will surely stay again here."
Review 102,"Like many hotels in NYC this one is an updated, but an old one with all the issues that would normally accompany one (poor lighting, plumbing tha rattles, small bathroom, etc). 
While i had a ""courtyard"" view (really just a brick wall 10 feet away from the window) there was none of the street noise that bothered others on the other side of the hotel. 
Finally - the 'free' breakfast leaves a lot to be desired, but at least the coffee is okay."
Review 103,"For my four-year-old's first trip to NYC, we stayed in a suite at The San Carlos, and what a treat! An immaculately clean bathroom (w/ a bath tub/shower--not always the case in NYC) and bedroom, plus a separate sitting room w/ a tiny kitchenette (no stove, but a sink, small fridge, coffee maker, microwave, dishes and utensils)--perfect for traveling w/ a small child. 
We were on the 17th floor w/ not much of a view and some minor street noise, but never anything disruptive. The staff were always smiling, helpful, and competent. And to top it off, the location cannot be beat--close to every thing we wanted to see and do: Rockefeller Center, the 5th Ave shops, hansom cab rides, tea at The Plaza, etc. 
If you're looking for 24 hour room service and a grand lobby, this is not the place for you. But if you want a nice, clean, convenient place to relax between outings, this place more than fits the bill. Overall, I'd definitely return to this hotel and heartily recommend it to anyone visiting NYC."
Review 104,"After AIRBNB cancelled our apartment reservation at the last minute (4 days prior to arrival) we contacted the San Carlos, a hotel the company has been using for years. We got an extremely reasonable price for a family suite and kept wondering after that why should we ever bother with the unreliable AIRBNB service ever again...We felt so pampered at the hotel!!
The suite was spacious. There's a bedroom with very comfortable bed, TV and closet. The living room has a foldout double sofa, with a very thick and comfortable mattress. Since we are 5 people they brought in another single bed, and the room still felt spacious. 
The living room area also has a TV, two armchairs, a small dining area with 4 chairs and a real kitchenette with microwave, small but real refrigerator and plenty of dishes. For breakfast, though, we used the hotel dining room downstairs. No cooked food, but still enough to get you started in the morning.
The only reservation we have about the room is the fact you can't really open the windows for fresh air (2nd floor) because the cooking fumes and odors you get from the restaurant next door. However, ventilation system is rather efficient.
Staff were very helpful and kind. They make you feel very much ""at home"" and as if each visitor is ""a regular"". 
Last but not least: Location! Initially we wanted to go for the village, but we actually found this location to be even better: easy access to all parts of the city and important destinations - central park and the museums, the MOMA is within minutes walk, Times Sq is close enough to walk and yet far enough... 5th avenue shopping area is really close. Warmly recommend it."
Review 105,"My friends and I had a great stay at the San Carlos Hotel. We all stayed together in a 1 bedroom queen suite. The bedroom had two queen beds, and we had a generously sized sitting area that included a sleeper sofa, 2 arm chairs, sink and fridge. The bedroom was also a nice size, and we had 2 closets with ample storage space. The room was clean and comfortable. The Aveda products in the bathroom were nice! We could hear a little bit of street noise, but it is NYC after all. The hotel itself was very quiet--I never heard any noise from other rooms. The front desk staff was very nice and helpful. Be sure to pick up a map! We also loved the bowls of fun size candy bars at the front desk. I'm not sure if that was leftover from Halloween or if they're always there, but my friends and I always made a quick stop to pick up a Hershey bar on the way in or out. One guy at the front desk was particularly helpful by arranging for a limo to take the 6 of us to our dinner destination one evening. We saved a bit on cab fare that evening and enjoyed the ride in the limo! The hotel is very convenient (1 block) to the subway on 51st and Lexington. There is also a great bagel place, Ess-A-Bagel on 3rd at about 49th or so. I will definitely stay at the San Carlos again if I ever have the chance to get back to New York."
Review 106,"I booked a room here to coach a writing client on her upcoming book, and it was the perfect place for it. The rooms are appointed with a long glass-topped surface spanning the entire drawers/fridge/desk, making it ideal for spreading out presentations, paperwork, or in our case, the book manuscript. The infinity pool and the hot tub on the 18th floor was a fabulous place to get away from it all, and so was the 024 bar with the super blue waterfall in its midst. Rich linens, thick towels, a bathrobe, double showerheads, and suede-like chairs, made this business trip a luxury I am eager to repeat! Perfect location across from the mall and restaurants, too. All floors accessible by room key only, including pool area."
Review 107,"A couple of friends and I took a road trip from New Orleans to Houston to see the Astros/Red Sox game. Our first night in Houston was at the St. Regis. We decided to stay at the Westin the 2nd night because it is brand new, not too far from downtown, and had a good rate. We loved the property even though it seemed deserted. I'm sure they are still trying to get the word out about themselves. The lobby and public spaces were beautiful and modern. Our room was a typical Westin room with amazing beds and a great tv. I was a bit diappointed as the shower and tub were not separate like in most Westins I've stayed in. We greatly enjoyed the Executive Lounge with wonderful snacks and a decent breakfast. The pool and fitness center on the 18th floor were really cool. We enjoyed the view of Houston from up there. The pool was a bit chilly and hot tub not warm. Maybe they can work those kinks out. The Il Mulino restaurant was amazing. We were the only people in the whole place. But, I loved my chicken piccata and their award winning meatballs. The hotel is in a great location with Target, Cheesecake Factory, and Memorial City Mall across the street. The valet was helpful. No one really offered to help with luggage. At check-in, the gentleman was cordial but not genuinely friendly. He was a bit stiff and quite consumed with the rules such as asking to see my AAA card, telling me I'd probably not get SPG points since we held the room with my friend's credit card even though it was booked in my name and paid for in cash, and letting us know we had to use our room keys to access the elevator. Overall, we enjoyed our experience but prefer the St. Regis a few miles away because of their outstanding service."
Review 108,"This hotel is within walking distance of many attractions in Manhattan: the United Nations, Times Square, MOMA, etc. We had a suite and it was very nice. New York is an expensive city and other, more famous hotels were charging much more for the same thing.
We did not eat in the restaurant as there was a good deli across the street and, of course, many restaurants nearby, but they do have a breakfast available.
 All in all, a good find."
Review 109,"Never having been to New York before, we chose the San Carlos after a lot of research. The location was centrally located, within walking to several sites, the subway and restaurants. We found the room to be spacious and clean. We were on the backside of the hotel so there was no view to speak of but that also meant very little street noise. I used the fitness facility, while small, it was adequate for my needs. Breakfast was included which wad a bonus. Just your typical assortment of yogurt, breads and juices it helped us curb costs and get through until late afternoon. The hotel staff was helpful in securing a cab to the airport and in recommending several nearby spots for casual dining. I would definitely recommend this hotel for anyone wanting a home base from which to plan their trip. It's not going to have the spa, or restaurant, or service of some 5 stars but we also didn't have to pay for that."
Review 110,"very nice hotel, quiet, clean, updated rooms with great A/C. The price is good as well, especially for the location - 50th and Lex. Enjoy!
However, you may want to skip the free breakfast - too many other choices in NYC."
Review 111,"Super comfortable rooms, modern but elegant decor and very good location. Just walk outside and a slew of great restaurants and shops are within minutes of walking distance. Front desk staff are welcoming and helpful. 
Direction to the place is a bit tricky"
Review 112,This hotel is awesome! From the looks to the rooms. We stayed in a balcony suite which was great... very spacious clean...The only thing is the view isn't the best but to me it didn't really matter cause the room was great. There is a skywalk to the mall which is convenient. Overall stay is much better than the Westin galleria. Will be coming back!
Review 113,"We stayed on a weekend. Nice new hotel, recently built, very clean. Valet staff was great - especially Jose/Diya. Front desk staff was polite but impersonal, very sterile. Answered your questions but with no warmth or inclination to be delightful and with one word replies. I am a gold SPG member and they pretended they had no upgraded rooms available. I persisted and told them I knew hotel was mostly vacant. Which is when they relented and upgraded me. Club floor lounge evening host was very nice and friendly, genuinely seeking to go above and beyond. Breakfast in the morning was a let down. Not refilled even when items ran out and not enough variety to begin with. Very easy skywalk access to the adjoining mall. Overall not a bad stay. But staff needed quite a bit of polishing and training."
Review 114,"I had to be in New York on late notice and was priced out of my favorite hotel, the New York Palace. I was able to secure a small suite at the San Carlos for about the same price I would pay for a room at the Palace (a bit more than $400/nt). While the service and amenities are not up to the same standard as a 5 star hotel, I had a very nice stay and would go again. Having two rooms plus a small kitchen counter and sink is a plus. If you are traveling and prefer to buy take-out and eat in your room it is a good set-up. Plus if you are on a business with your spouse one person can work, talk on the phone or watch TV while the other sleeps in the bedroom. There was a free continental breakfast next the lobby but I did not have time to partake, It did rain one of the days I was there and a pile of umbrellas greeted guests as they walked out the door. The location, 50th and 3rd is excellent with great restaurants all around and not far from shopping and the theatre. They do not have the most luxurious furniture but it was more than adequate. The older AC was a bit noisy but these are minor complaints to a very nice stay. I will stay again."
Review 115,"My wife and I stayed here for 5 nights. The hotel was very centrally located with many great restaurants and sights within walking distance. The room was very clean and comfortable. Our room was on the back side of the hotel and we did not hear any street noise. Not much a view, just the back of another building, but we slept great. Staff was friendly and the price was reasonable. We highly recommend this hotel."
Review 116,"We stayed in an executive suite with our baby daughter for week and loved the hotel. It's in a great location, the staff were friendly and really helpful and it's not often you get breakfast (albeit a continental one) and free wifi included in your room rate.
Our room was of a decent size, the kitchen area was well stocked, the small dining table and sofa came in handy and the beds extremely comfortable. We found the doorman and reception staff to most helpful and pleasant throughout our stay.
The only one thing I could fault was the carpets could have done with a better hoover on our arrival. It‚Äôs a small point as all other cleanliness was spot on."
Review 117,"My husband and I picked this hotel for the size of the room as my mom stayed with us a few nights. The room overall was in a good location and big in size (except for the bathroom). However, the housekeeping is a huge disappointment. When we arrived, the sheets were stained. This is a small hotel, so we were left to chg the sheets on our own. Then the next day, I noticed that the hall 1/2 bath had urine underneath the toilet bowl by the floor. I informed the front desk, and again, never got a response. The urine was left on the toilet bowl. When my mom, arrived, she found filthy, stained sheets on her fold out couch. The stains appeared to be blood stained. Also, we asked housekeeping to refill the towels in the 1/2 bath, but again, to no avail. I wd also not recommend this hotel if you are new to nyc. They do not have a real concierge. The doorman was great, however."
Review 118,"First impression upon arrival set the tone for the rest of our stay. It was extremely difficult even with GPS to find this Hotel the only indication that we saw that helped was the HS initials on the valet booth. Pulled up to the valet and was informed that the garage was at full capacity and that even though we needed to park handicap we would have to park two blocks away and tote our luggage to the hotel. When we finally made it inside to the hotel we were completely lost because you then have to tote your luggage up a wooden flight of stairs to check in on the second floor. We later learned that there was a side door that led to the elevators. A first time visitor like myself would have never guessed that...I traveled with a group of 6 and overall if you don't mind early morning construction noise or occasional loud music from the club area or the courtyard then this is most definitely the place to stay. 
I must say that we had a few minor hiccups during our stay and after we expressed our concerns to the Assistant General Manager he did go out of his way to personally make things right. So I will spare the details of the minor issues we faced and focus on the many positive. I would most definitely stay here again if I was looking for a weekend get-a-way spot for romance or a place to party with my girlfriends. Hotel Sorella is sleek, stylish and very innovative. I loved the design of the Hotel. My room was clean, modern and well stocked. We ordered breakfast one morning that was perfectly delish. I would recommend the vegetable omelet and the steak and eggs. The complimentary breakfast consist of all the fruits your heart desires, dry cereal and milk and pastries. Monnalisa is a great bar that has a very stylish atmosphere and great drinks. 
I was a little disappointed with how early the surrounding restaurants close on the weekends. Most of the kitchens close at 11:30 which is no fault of the hotels but the hotel's kitchen/room service closes at 10pm as well."
Review 119,"This is a nice modern hotel in a very affluence mall area.
I like it overall but there are few flaws that I wish they would correct:
1. it is very hard find this place - no signs. Many drivers get lost. I come here often because my company puts all visiting staff here.
2. the bell man do not have good attitudes. Some of them look like they have side business and not paying attention. Once I had to demand that they carry my luggage as the guy talk away on the cell phone.
3. the wifi speed is slow. It is about 0.5 MB/sec. It is ok for emails but not if you want to watch a video.
4. it is noise because there is an outdoor cafe with people hanging out. May be a better sound proofing window would make a difference?"
Review 120,"Room was awesome! Super clean! Love the wood floors and only carpet near bed. Great for allergies! I always wonder if the carpeted hotel rooms have dirt or God knows what else that hasn't been properly cleaned. I only wish they had a way to play music like an iPod station, etc. Also, the food could be better. Our breakfast arrived cold. The dessert selection wasn't great. I couldn't believe they didn't have hot chocolate or even 24 hour room service. Overall, I would return in a heartbeat."
Review 121,"Noisy? Yes. Clean and comfortable? Absolutely! I will stay here again even though it is a bit noisy. The noise is due to the availability of many restaurants, shops, bars, and a cinema right next door. It is also due to these noisy hot-spots that you will also be treated to a great view of fountains with fire and beautifully lighted trees. We even saw a dance recital on the green, right from our window. The breakfast is good, much better than the danish and cold eggs at most chains. They provide specialty teas and coffees, high-end pastries, and fresh fruit. We have stayed here twice and can't imagine why anyone would give Hotel Sorella bad ratings."
Review 122,"I think that says it all! But a few more details--our suite was spacious and luxuriously appointed. It was so new that the bedside lamps were not even plugged in yet. The check-in staff was friendly and thus learned that we were celebrating a special event. They surprised us later with a plate of giant strawberries with warm chocolate sauce for dipping! Fortunately, we also thought the gym was terrific. All the equipment is new, and the views from the 17th floor give you something to watch while on the treadmill. The room-service breakfast (oatmeal with banana brulee) was one of my favorite breakfasts ever."
Review 123,"Everything at the Westin costs extra. $10/ day for the internet. $12/ day for self parking. $10 for a simple bowl of oatmeal. $5 for a not very nice capuccino. The location is good for shopping. The gym and pool are excellent, if you have time to use them. It is brand new, so squeaky clean. Service is fine. Bed and pillows are good. Desk is well appointed for working a weekend away. The light in the bathroom is blinding. I am undecided if I will stay here on my next visit, but thus far I have no compelling reason to return."
Review 124,"Westin Houston still had that fresh paint clean smell upon arrival. We were eagerly greeted by valets who were semi-informative on self-parking. During check-in, we were informed that our reservation had been made for the wrong day. Although the situation was easily fixed once we received the help from a busy manager, the front desk man who was doing his best was not doing much at all.
The physical appearance of the hotel was very captivating. The design was functional, and was complimented by the cleanliness of the hotel. The pleasing aesthetics of the room were not an overstatement. The room in which I stayed was one of the cleanest rooms I have seen in a hotel. Most of the guest service staff were willing to help and upheld friendly attitudes. 
We didn't spend much time in the hotel due to the nature of our business trip. Most of our time spent in the hotel was after 10PM. We did not have a personal vehicle to travel downtown, nor did we have the energy to take a 25 minute cab ride. One unfortunate detail about this time of night in the area is that most businesses were closed after 9:30 PM. Inside the hotel the pool was closed, the adjoining restaurant was closed and the ""024 Lounge"" was a make-shift location for a business event due to everything else being closed (needless to say there was no room in the bar). We were made to feel as if we were intruding on a private event.
My colleagues and I are not of business formal appearance. Although we were either business casual or causally dressed, sneers did make their way across the room (mainly from hotel staff). From the moment of our arrival, our presence was continuously questioned. After returning from our event, we spent time lounging in the common areas. It was during this time that we were physically questioned by a judgmental security personnel while drunkenly, sloppy guests seemed to have more welcome. Although it was not an issue the first encounter, it began to disturb us once he continued to question into us being there (after we had to show our room key and provide our room number).
We enjoyed our stay at the Westin. The location of the hotel was conveniently located in relation to downtown Houston. Our room is very clean with all amenities provided, the hotel was up-kept by a wonderful custodial staff and the late-night room service staff was probably the most helpful personnel we encountered. I would stay again at the Westin Houston Memorial.
If you are considering this hotel for either business or leisure, I would inform you to not have high expectations if you are a ""night owl"", or work late evenings, with hopes to have something to do around the hotel location. If you are one who dresses casually or enjoys dressing comfortably, around your hotel or in general, be prepared to face some criticism/questionable profiling."
Review 125,"Stayed at the Drury, for 7 days in December. It was just like home! Excellent care and staff were the nicest I have ever met at any hotel! Maria who took care of my room, Annette who was the morning cook, Erika the evening bar lady, Wow, they really became like family to me. I really miss them all. Thank you to all the staff. Hotel pool, exercise room, dining area, location, all was perfect. I certainly will return here for another visit. Wish they had a Drury here in Montreal. Also the drinks at 5:30pm were just perfect along with a nice choise of food."
Review 126,"Met all standards and then some. Location is convenient to all locations I need to get to while in Houston, Hotel is friendly, clean, free dinner and breakfast, parking. Rooms are good. No complaints and a terrific value for less than $150 per night!"
Review 127,"Aging, noisy and somewhat dilapidated with a constant buzzing noise in the room noted by two guests in different rooms on different floors. Smelled badly of cigarettes throughout the hotel. SHeets old and bedding old fashioned. The hotel is no frills at all: basic and none too clean. The breakfast was the ""plastic"" kind - plastic cups for coffee, plastic plates and utensils and stale eggs, sweet rolls and the usual cereals. The pool is a ""dipping pool"" and none too clear. Avoid this hotel."
Review 128,"We came back to the SC after staying here a year ago. TA will delete my older review so if you look for it it won't be there. Anyway..it's a great deal in Manhattan!! A one-bedroom suite with kitchenette for less than $400!! What a deal!! It's in a great location that's close to great shopping, dining, and the subway. The staff is always helpful and friendly. The rooms are HUGE and most importantly quiet. Sure, there is some siren noise, but not much. The beds are comfortable as well. The breakfast is typical; yogurt, baked goods, toaster items, cereal, etc. This hotel always impresses me as a luxury hotel without the luxury price tag. Expect robes, turn down service, a pants press (??), two flat screen TVs, two closets, etc., etc... We'll be back for third visit for sure."
Review 129,"All the way around, this is a superior hotel. My wife and I spent three nights there over the Columbus Day weekend, with two teenage boys. Everything is superb and we will return if the opportunity arises. Plenty of space in our one-bedroom suite, very clean, thorough room attention each day, perfect bed, more than ample free breakfast food, friendly helpful staff, tasteful wall hangings, better than average fitness room, great location in Manhattan mid-town east right next to 51st and Lexington subway. One final thing -- when we checked out, the man at the front desk did a magic trick for my younger boy. This is a really special place. Kudos to TripAdvisor for bringing it to my attention!"
Review 130,"We stayed in an Executive Suite. It had plenty of room for NYC even with 2 young children -- including floor space, a small ""kitchen"" table, couch, coffee table, kitchenette. The continental breakfast had a good selection and was well supplied. The doorman was friendly and provided us with umbrellas on our way out when it was raining. We were able to borrow a DVD player from the front desk. We all agreed we'd stay here again."
Review 131,We stayed at the Sorella Hotel with our young son over Thanksgiving weekend. The hotel is smallish in a european style and conveniently located for west Houston/Memorial access. Pros: Shopping and restaurants are within easy walking distance and include a wide variety of favorites. The hotel is very clean and our room on the 8th floor was quiet and comfortable. We appreciated the fresh apples and bottled water in our room on arrival as well as the complimentary cocktails. Didn't try the breakfast offered. Enjoyed the engineered wooden floors in our room. Cons: Small unheated pool was more of a landscape feature than a functional pool...unusable in November and disappointed my son. Bathrooms have great walk in showers but are sparsely furnished with towels and extras. No hotel news stand that I could find and no newspaper delivery to rooms.
Review 132,"I went online and saw the pics and the place looks just like the pics, BEAUTIFUL! So before going to our room went ate at Yard House which the food was mouth watery good! After a midnight meal and drinks we walk to the hotel room. This place is new and very upscale. My date had the chocolate covered strawberries and champigan. Honestly the chocolate was no govida but it was nice and the champigan was not something i would have picked out but the thought was really good. lol...We stayed in 802 which over looks the court yard great view...I give it 5 stars and i would love to go back"
Review 133,"Getting off a plane and picking up a hire car after a day's travelling is never great at the best of times, but when the Sat Nav doesn't recognise the address of the hotel (too new I think), and when you do get to the general area, the hotel doesn't have one of the usual american-style massive billboards on top, it leads to some ""interesting"" detours!
After a bit of to-ing and fro-ing, I eventually managed to find the hotel car park and check in.
The rooms were very good, and the bed really comfortable. A little 'control panel' in the desk had all the connections needed to charge mobile phones, mp3 players etc. and was a good idea. Alarm clock was an hour out (clocks had just gone back) which was a bit confusing, but I tend to rely on my phone to wake me up in any case.
Communal areas clean and tidy. Bar was dark and trendy. Didn't have much in the way of interaction with staff during my stay, but check in and out were as efficient as you would expect.
Great location - you can actually walk to a number of shops and restaurants, which is unusual for Houston."
Review 134,"This place is great during the week, but stay away on the weekend.
They book a lot of weddings, and it is extremely loud.
Do not stay on the courtyard side of the hotel on the weekend - unless you are out until after the bands stop playing in the bars - around 3AM.
A very nice hotel - but definitely missing something at this price point. 
FYI - I travel a great deal for business (3 months a year) and would not recommend this hotel if you plan on staying over the weekend."
Review 135,"The new Westin at Memorial City is in a great location for West Houston, located on the I10 at Gessner and easy to reach both the Energy Corridor and Downtown locations. There is a direct connection to the excellent Memorial City Mall by a covered walkway(A&F, Hollister, etc and Cinemax complex). Good gym facilities and small pool and jacuzzi on the 18th floor with views over the City - though this area could do with a little tropical greenery.
High energy attentive staff do make a real difference and special mention to all the people at the front desk, bar and shuttle service.
Some suggestions:
Improved signage for walkway to mall / Hertz office
More toiletries / towels in bedrooms
Consider installing free wi-fi in lobby"
Review 136,"Recently in Houston on business and decided to stay at the Westin Memorial which just opened a few weeks ago. I had driven by the Memorial many times in the past and it looked great so I was eager to see how it would turn out. The lobby is big with lots of check in counters, a restaurant, sundry shop and bar. The staff is friendly and accommodating and the amenities are great.
Pros:
- Staff was friendly and helpful
- Rooms were nice with good views overlooking the city
- They have an Executive Lounge for Starwood Gold/Platinum on the 18th floor which provides continental breakfast and happy hour each day.
- The workout facility has everything you need.
- The pool on the 18th floor is great and it also opens up to the outside. It has a beautiful view overlooking the city and is definitely worth a visit. 
Cons:
- Still new, and they are ironing out some of the basic kinks
- You need your key card to be able to use the elevator for any floor. This is a good security feature but quickly becomes cumbersome. Also- on the last day my card stopped working, so I had to wait for someone to help me get downstairs just so I could get a new card to use to get back into my room.
Overall, this is a great new hotel and definitely a step up over the Galleria and Oaks."
Review 137,"Found this hotel easily using out sat nav system. Check in was smooth, which following a long flight was just what was needed. The receptionist was very friendly and provided us with the relevant information relating to the complimentary breakfast. The latter was sufficient for our needs and filled us up for a day of sightseeing. It included hot and cold options, including a waffle maker. The staff were very friendly and knowledgeable, always willing to help. The hotel manager also mingled with the guests during breakfast. This hotel also supplied hot food at tea time which we did not sample but included foods such as hot dogs and other such delights.
As you have guessed, this is a decent hotel but you will need a car to get to places from there, which is the same throughout Houston. It is exactly as described, the rooms were clean and roomy and serviced daily which is just what we needed, plus there was unlimited free wifi access throughout the hotel."
Review 138,"A very good Hotel friendly staff. We are from the U.K. My partner had to go away on business for a few days and l felt quite safe on my own. The manager came round every breakfast time and said hello to everybody.Not a lot of choice at breakfast but nice fresh bread and lovely scrambled egg.Free food in the evening, again not a lot of choice but nice baked potatoes and salad..There is a small shopping centre Uptown Park 5minutes walk that has a few shops Starbucks and a great restaurant called Mccormick & Schmick's. The hotel has a small fitness centre and pool but the spa is lovely after a hard days shopping at The Galleria (5min in a taxi)?..From Pat"
Review 139,"The place was a little hard to find if you never been to Houston before.
My GPS was not able to locate the location, good thing on the Drury web site it also list the long and lat corrdinates that I can enter into the GPS.
Was going to stay in another hotel in south Houston, this location was selected due to one place that I need to go. Due to my surprise, my friend moved just 10 miles west of the hotel. This worked out very nice for me.
Saw the review from globetrotter15_25 about the towels being old and worn.
The towels in the room were nice.
At the time that we stay at the Drury Inn, the next morning notice a lot of people leaving with dogs. I did not know that there were pets allowed. Later on discover that there was a dog show that weekend and there were poeple staying at the hotel with there dogs. During the night did not hear a dogs barking. Then again I may be tired from the long drive.
At 5:30pm they have some thing called ""Kickback"", basically FREE Hot Food & Cold Beverages (soda). This was a nice surpise, I knew about the free breakfast and the WiFi but not about the ""kickback"".
Parking is gated.
The room is nice and clean.
The staff is friendly.
There is a Target store very close by which is very nice."
Review 140,"On the 23 Of July 2011 my husband and I attended the Sade Concert in Houston Texas at the Toyota Center.
While we were there, over night, we stayed at the Drury Inn located at 1615 W. Loop South. The associate at the desk during check in was a very friendly young man, with a great sense of humor. 
Our stay at the hotel was A+! 
 This is why we continue to choose this hotel location time after time when visiting the Houston area. The staff is very professional and friendly. The rooms are very clean and neat, the beds are comfortable and everything you need is right there at the hotel. This hotel offers a hot breakfast with waffles, an afternoon snack and cocktails along with popcorn and drinks for the children.
The grounds around the hotel are clean and well maintained. Having had a car stolen while visiting Houston once what impressed my husband most about this hotel location is that there is a gated parking area that allows you to exit the parking lot only with the use of your room key; Is this security or What!"
Review 141,"Overall by experience at this suite was a good one. I'd stay here again, but like any other hotel it does have drawbacks. It is very clean and has good decor and flat screens in every room. The breakfasts and dinners served are very good and it features free soda and popcorn during the afternoon. 
The staff is my only exception. They are helpful but very paranoid about who stays in the hotel and who doesn't. They don't give me a welcome feeling, and it seems like you can't relax or get work done downstairs because they usually ask to see your room key to prove that you're staying there."
Review 142,"This hotel is right next to an extraordinarily busy and noisy highway. So the noise is relentless.Staff is not responsive to requests for a quieter room saying there aren't any. The rooms facing away from highway are above the bar where, according to the staff, the music goes very late. In today;s world there are noise-blocking window technologies. This hotel needs to invest in them."
Review 143,"We stayed at Hotel Sorella over the weekend of 10/28-10/30 for our wedding. We also blocked rooms for our guests as well. The hotel was very modern, contemporary and clean. Location is great and there are many bars/restaurant/shops w/i walking distance, which is unheardof for Houston. The rooms are spacious and clean and the staff is very accommodating. I highly recommend Hotel Sorella. It's best to request a room overlooking the courtyard, as the others face the highway/construction."
Review 144,"Adecuado para viaje de negocios; el desayuno se toma en un restaurante del centro comercial Gallerie, al cual se accede directamente desde el Hotel. Buena atenci√≥n del personal y aseo. Las habitaciones c√≥modas y con balc√≥n."
Review 145,"Good location, pleasant staff, excellent breakfast options. The room was clean and fairly comfortable, though a bit crowded with a king bed. Parking was plentiful and close. The one bad point was the poor condition of the towels: old, worn, and often stained, they were very unappealing and quite a contrast from the otherwise good quality furnishings."
Review 146,"My family and I were all very pleased with the hotel. There were 6 of us and we had adjoining rooms. So many pluses that you don't get at other hotels - FREE breakfast, FREE parking, FREE wifi, indoor/outdoor pool, and the ""Kick Back"" time was awesome which included lots of snacks, free fountain drinks, and even 3 alchoholic drinks per adult per night. The hotel was very clean and close to everything we wanted to do and the employees were professional and friendly. The price was great too, especially for all the perks you get! We would definitely stay there again!"
Review 147,"We loved everything about our stay at the Drury Inn Galleria. We were in Houston for a medical appointment, and chose this location for a change, as we usually stay in the Texas Medical Center. First of all, you never have to worry about he kids being hungry, there is always somehing to eat. The kids spent most of the time at the indoor-outdoor pool. We loved taking our free cocktails, popcorn, sodas, and evening food, and kicking back at the pool. The kids also loved the glass elevator, and beautiful lobby. The breakfast was delicious. The staff was incredible too, plenty of people were always around to help. The rooms were very clean. There were also vending machines, and a washer/dryer. We were happy to have a microwave, fridge in the room too. I will stay at this hotel from now on. The Galleria was around the corner."
Review 148,"Can't say enough good things about this hotel. Priced similarly to a Westin or JW but more chic. Outstanding free continental breakfast makes it a great value. Our room was very quiet. Stayed for ten nights and only noise was very muted jazz music by a band in the plaza below from 6 until 9 on the weekend. While here, we learned it was just named to Conde Nast Gold List (#12 in U.S.). Loved having all the great restaurants and shops around us...tons within walking distance. The hub is a plaza next to the hotel with open space, fountains and fire pits, which seems to serve as a neighborhood gathering place for young and old in the evening. Very European. Lots of fun to watch the little rug rats run around the green space, but few families staying at the hotel. Mostly business people. All 5 star amenities except turndown service and slippers, both far outweighed by the beautiful breakfast and 4 star rates. Huge and efficient walk in shower (no tub) and single sink with plenty of counter space. Everything well designed. Deluxe rooms overlook the plaza, standard ones see the freeways. All are large and the entire hotel looks exactly as it does on the web site. Valet parking is available but pricey and not necessary. There is free parking a few steps from the lobby, which is actually located on the second floor. I'd stay here again in a heartbeat."
Review 149,"Was here on business for two weeks, my wife came along for the trip... We both enjoyed our stay here, hotel was great, location was perfect (for shopping, eating & drinking) and room was decent! The only one negative thing I would have is the gym was pretty poor, but I think all guests get free passes to the external gym which is just 100 meters away from the hotel...
I will return to sorella next time I'm in Houston on business and would definatly recommend it to anyone..."
Review 150,"We stayed here this past weekend mainly because of positive reviews on TripAdvisor. Its the first time Trip Advisor has done me wrong. We were given a room that backed up to the Sam Houston Tollway. The accomodations were fine, the room and lobby attractive,...blah blah blah. The problem began at 7am when the construction adjacent to the hotel started. We were awoken to the sounds of bulldozers and other large machinery. That was only the beginning....That night music being played below by an out outdoor musician sounded like he was standing and playing in our room. The music went on well past midnight. It was ridiculous. I have never stayed in a hotel where noise was this much of a factor. Oh, and I failed to mention that we could hear anyone out in the hallway as clear as day. The floors that they use in the rooms allow sound to travel unbelievably. Anyway, the buffet was great and the beds comfy but nothing makes me more miserable than being constantly assaulted by sound in the privacy of my room....To make matters worse when I was checking out and the receptionist asked how my stay was she made no comment after I said ""Terrible""."
Review 151,"This hotel was a conference destination, but would be a great get away destination if you are wanting an urban experience. Great shops, restaurants, etc."
Review 152,"Hotel is ok, no thrills. Room was clean with all the basic amenities, clean towels every day. Breakfast was ok nothing special. Gym is a small room with 4 threadmills and a TV. Thin walls could hear the other guests TV's through the wall."
Review 153,"my partner and I were visiting family in Katy, we wanted to say in a new hotel and are glad we decided to stay at Hotel Sorella.. very very nice place, service was excellent, rooms VERY NICE. i will stay here again.."
Review 154,"I stayed there once last October for business and I wasn't really fascinated, but after another experience, I have to say it is good. Unless you can go to an higher level (galeria), then this is your choice.
Rooms and hotel are new, clean, no problems at all. Fancy style hotel. It was built on an area where there was a commercial center. So now everything is new.
Around there are restaurants at a walking distance (unheard for Houston), you better go there as I tried the restaurant of the hotel and it wasn't great.
The view from the hotel is the highway, and you are not downtown. So evaluate what you want from your Houston trip.
It is a bit expensive generally speaking, but I did not find any great deals in Houston for this level of hotels."
Review 155,"Clean sleek and modern. Great for a weekend getaway. Free breakfast with juices, yogurt, danish, cereal, fruit & great coffee! Food and drinks is a bit pricey at hotel. There are other places to eat very close by. On Sat live music on the green that is kid friendly. Sushi place under , hotel that has great prices at happy hour. Room is clean sleek & modern. Flat screen tv, mini bar, cd player, hook up for ipod, ironing board, free breakfast, free wi-fi and nice comfy plush robes."
Review 156,"After several stays this place is the tops. The rooms are nice, the staff helpful and the location great. The other plus point is a nice breakfast with plenty of original and healthy options."
Review 157,"We chose the San Carlos Hotel solely because of the TripAdvisor reviews we read about it. We had an interior room which was quiet and cozy. The rooms have a refrigerator, microwave and coffee-maker. Wi-Fi throughout the hotel and also a wonderful business center with several computers with internet access and connected printers. The workout room was perfect as well - TV's, towels, bathroom, and all the necessary exercise equipment. The Hotel Staff was spectacular... helpful, kind, efficient and quick. We arrived early in the morning on a Tuesday (red-eye flight) and were able to get into our room at 10am to nap and shower. The Aveda shampoos, soaps and lotions were wonderful and the bed was the best hotel bed we have ever slept in. The location could not be better... walking distance to Central Park, Rockefeller Center, Times Square and easy Subway access to everywhere else. Next time we travel to NYC, we will be staying at the San Carlos Hotel."
Review 158,"We found the San Carlos through TripAdvisor and couldn't have been more delighted. It was one of the best hotels I've ever stayed in in NYC. The location was supurb, the front desk very welcoming and our rooms immaculately clean, spacious and away from any street noise. We couldn't believe our great good fortune. The continental breakfast was generous with sweet rolls, patisseries, yogurt, orange juice, coffee, tea, fresh fruit, cottage cheese, etc. The 24/7 internet availability was convenient as were the 24/7 gym facilities. The room was tastefully decorated, the bathroom smacking clean and up-scale modernized, the beds amazingly comfortable with lovely linens, and the staff and personnel couldn't have been more accommodating and gracious. All in all, the San Carlos is a hotel that we can recommend without reservation. Hello to Gabriel and to Bobby...two of the staff members who are excellent representatives of the San Carlos's impeccable hospitality."
Review 159,"I have just returned to London today, having spent five nights at the San Carlos, which I picked out from Trip Advisor reviews. Expedia informed them it would be my birthday when I was staying. Upon arrival I found a beautiful room big enough for three, and a fabulous gift box of goodies with a Happy Birthday note. You can't top that! The staff were exceptionally helpful and polite. The hotel is situated in a very nice part of Manhattan and very near the subway - you can get just about anywhere! My room had a fridge with small freezer, microwave, china and coffee maker always supplied with coffee. I cannot fault the San Carlos and need to save up to return as soon as I can!"
Review 160,"We found this hotel on tripadvisor and were delighted we did. We were given the high floor room we requested -- it was spotless, extremely comfortable, quiet, and pleasant in every way. There was a fridge and microwave as well as free wifi. The staff were friendly and helpful and the few mistakes they made were quickly and pleasantly corrected. Breakfast was fine, too, and the location was perfect. I've been recommending the San Carlos to everyone."
Review 161,"We visited in the first couple of days in August, the staff were friendly and helpful, the rooms were spotless, we had a suite so that our teenager could have his own space. It was plenty big and really clean. Situated right in the heart of midtown we couldn't have been in a better position. I would definitely stay here again without hesitation."
Review 162,"I have stayed at several of the name brand hotels in TimeSquare and in the theater district, but once I found the San Carlos Hotel -- it's hard to imagine staying anywhere else in the city for the same star rating & cost. I've been a guest at the San Carlos 4 times now, and the appeal is the location, the staff and the quality of the rooms. You are conveniently located near many places to see & tour since you are at 50th & Second St. -- you can walk to Radio City, Rockefeller Center and Times Square, plus a subway station is nearby. The choice of restuarants is really great & also in walking distance on 50th & Second & Third & Lexington. Better food and better prices than in Times Square or the theater district. If its your first time in NYC you may be more comfortable in Times Square hotels to easily find your way around, but if you are returning to NYC, you won't be sorry if you try the San Carlos Hotel -- the staff and atmosphere are superb! We got a jr. suite at a special rate on the hotel web-site for a price we had a regular room here and at other places in the past. So check their web site for specials. If you can find a good rate, book with confidence and know you won't be disappointed."
Review 163,"My wife and two younger children stayed here for three nights. The room was spacious, clean, and the most well-lit I've ever been to. There were power outlets EVERYWHERE! There was a refrigerator as well. The pull-out sleep sofa mattress was comfortable, and the service was outstanding. Free wireless is another plus. When we return to NYC, we will definitely stay here again."
Review 164,"Just back from a 2 night stay at San Carlos hotel in one bedroom suite ,great
experience , staff friendly ,offered late check out free of charge,can't understand the
moans about breakfast its included in rate it was a good bonus"
Review 165,"We found this hotel through Trip Advisor and couldn't have been happier. We had one bed suite, roomy with kitchenette ideal with 2 children. Staff friendly especially Bobby. We were more than happy with breakfast, and free wifi and cleanliness very good. We stayed longer because of hurricane Irene but were glad to do so."
Review 166,We stayed at San Carlos Hotel for 4 days. We would definately recommend and return to this hotel.
Review 167,"Great hotel. We couldn't fault it apart from the breakfasts which were a little basic. Great location, clean and comfortable and the staff were always helpful.We really enjoyed our five night stay!"
Review 168,"Had never heard of this hotel before, but pictures looked great so we went for it - very hard to find reasonably priced suite in NYC, We were not disappointed! The room was huge, especially for NYC. Very well kept, very quiet, the staff was very friendly, especially Mathew the doorman. The free buffet breakfast was very basic (limited pastry selection, toast, yogurt, plus coffee, etc) but good. Highly recommend it for families. We are a family of 5 (2 parents, a 5 yr old, 2 yr old, and 3 mo old) and it was perfect for us."
Review 169,"Rooms are just fine -- not huge, but lots of really nice touches - a mini bar + fridge + microwave + coffeemaker. The top floor suite, if you 'go for broke' is great with rooftop terrace. But even the basic rooms have really nice flat screen TV, great beds and bedding, and very spiffy brand new telephones. Desk service is delightful - personal, charming, welcoming - you feel like an old friend the moment you walk in. Convenient mid-town location, easy walk to the best shopping- uptown to Bloomingdale's, west a few blocks to Fifth Avenue - and a few more blocks to theatre. And parking just $30 a day -- good price for NYC. And free continental breakfast as well, a real added benefit."
Review 170,"We (Family of 3 including teenage son) have just returned home from a 15 day stay at the San Carlos. We had a one bedroomed suite (2 queens and a sofa bed in lounge).
We found all of the staff to be courteous, friendly and professional. The suite was clean and spacious, and the quality of the towels and linen excellent. My son had use of the free WiFi in our suite with his laptop - though there are adequate PC's available to use .on the second floor. I used the dry-cleaning service and this was really quick.
The self service breakfast was a selection of pastries, cereal, juice, yogurts,l frech coffee etc., which was more than adequate.
The hotel is really handy for the subway, and within walking distance of all the main streets you need to visit.
Though our next trip to New York will be a shorter one - we WILL be staying at the San Carlos!"
Review 171,"This was my second time staying in this hotel. We were in NYC for 4 nights and this hotel was ideal as a central point for the different activities that we had planned. Rooms are good sized (for NYC) and staff is friendly and helpful. Several times we asked the staff for help on restaurants or directions and their advice was always ""spot on"". We used the breakfast buffet (adequate continental breakfast) and internet service (good - though not always fast). Lastly....and one of those little things that make service good...on the one very rainy night during our stay they had a large quantity of good portable umbrellas that people could take with them for the evening."
Review 172,"We loved the San Carlos! From the minute we arrived we were treated like old friends. The front desk (Evelyn & Gabriel) were helpful and tried their best to get an early check in into our suite beacuse we arrived at about 9 a.m., but nothing was availble. While we waited, the front desk staff entertained our kids with magic tricks! When they did get us in (still a few hours earlier than official check in time) they gave us a beautiful suite on the 16th floor (quiet, spacious, good air conditioner-we were there during a heat wave). . The bell staff (Bobby, Johan and Matthew) were friendly and knowledgable, and gave us good suggestions for families since we were tourists traveling with a 10- & 11-year-old. During our stay there were thunderstorms and the hotel had ""loaner"" umbrellas near the door for our use as we cruised around the city, which was great.
I've read complaints from others about the conteniental breakfast, but we thought it was plenty of food and choices. Since it was included in the room price for the four of us, it was a terrific value (you can't beat free). The breakfast consisted of rolls, assorted pastries, bagels, (the little chocolate croissants were especially yummy), tea, coffee, hot chocolate, milk, orange juice, assorted yogurts, cottage cheese, whole apples, assorted jams, cream cheese, Rice Krispies and Corn Flakes. The nice lady working at the breakfast kept everything well stocked throughout the morning (7-10 a.m.)
Our suite was clean and well appointed and roomy (we couln't believe we had that much space in mid-town Manhattan). The housekeeping staff was wonderful too. They were available the minute we requested anything. Returning from our daily adventures, the place was always spotless and my dirty dishes were the all done. What a luxury! The kitchenette came with a microwave, refridgerator, sink, dishes/service for 4 +. 
The Hotel location is also wonderful. It's walking distance to many attractions and a variety of restaurants (although there is a subway station not too far away). The front door staff is on top of it when you need a cab hailed (although much of the time we just tried to walk off the great Italian food we'd eaten in the neighborhood).
The staff of the hotel went well above our expectations. We will ONLY stay at the San Carlos when we return to NYC. My kids are already saying, ""We miss the San Carlos."" Me too..."
Review 173,I don't think I have one bad thing to say about the San Carlos.
Review 174,"We flew into Newark and didn't arrive at the hotel until midnight. Bellperson on duty (Matt) was exceptional! Delivered our bags, set our thermostat, gave us a brief rundown of the entire suite. From the staff, we got restaurant recommendations, directions, etc. Always a smile, a joke, a friendly face. The suite itself was like a small apartment! Clean, comfortable beds, with room to move around. Even our 15 year old loved it, and she's the pickiest in our family! Continental breakfast left a bit to be desired, but everything else more than made up for it!!"
Review 175,"Eine bessere Lage wird man in New York City f√ºr ein Hotel wohl nicht finden. Das Sherry Netherland liegt im Herzen von Manhattan an der 5th Avenue direkt am s√ºdlichen Anfang des Central-Parks und neben dem ber√ºhmten Glass-Cube Apple-Store. Man kann also problemlos zu Fu√ü zum Shopping-Marathon aufbrechen oder (am besten am Wochenende) einen Spaziergang im Central-Park unternehmen.
Wir hatten eine sehr ger√§umige und stilvoll eingerichtete ""Courtyard View"" Suite im 11. Stock. Obwohl in einem der Zimmer gegen√ºber zur Zeit unseres Aufenthalts Renovierungsarbeiten liefen, haben wir in unserem Zimmer nie etwas davon geh√∂rt. Die Schallisolierung der Zimmer ist also hervorragend. Die Mini-Bar (Wasser und Softdrinks) geh√∂rte zum Zimmer mit dazu und wurde t√§glich kostenlos aufgef√ºllt.
Das Personal war einfach gro√üartig, immer freundlich und sehr hilfsbereit. Erst im Nachhinein haben herausgefunden, dass unser pers√∂nlicher Liebling Bell Captain Pete Brito (und das sehr zu Recht) zum New Yorker Bellboy des Jahres ausgezeichnet wurde. In Erinnerung blieb auch der Portier, der sich todesmutig in den New Yorker Rush-Hour Verkehr warf, um uns ein Taxi zum Airport zu besorgen. Ohne ihn w√§ren wir wahrscheinlich heute noch dort ;) Ich glaub dass es in New York kaum ein anderes Hotel geben wird, in dem man genauso herzlich und freundlich behandelt wird wie im Sherry.
Die Zimmerpreise sind nat√ºrlich relativ hoch, aber die Reise und der Aufenthalt waren es definitiv wert! Wir k√∂nnen das Hotel uneingeschr√§nkt empfehlen!"
Review 176,"Das Sherry Netherland liegt direkt am Central Park und somit in einer einzigartig guten Lage zum Shoppen und Sightseeing! Wir hatten ein sehr ger√§umiges, sauberes Zimmer direkt zur Strasse, somit einen tollen Blick auf Manhattan und Park, trotzdem war es v√∂llig leise, da sehr guter Schallschutz.
Sehr freundliches und hilfsbereites Personal; Hotel ist uneingeschr√§nkt zu empfehlen."
Review 177,"L'albergo si trova praticamente di fronte al Plaza e al Central Park nella Fifth Avenue; posizione bellissima e molto comoda. Albergo vecchio stile ma molto ben tenuto; camere molto pulite e servizio attento. La Concierge Tammy molto brava, efficiente e collaborativa.
Purtroppo il servizio di Ristorazione √® dato in gestione al Ristorante Harry Cipriani e quindi al mattino, la piccola colazione mancava di atmosfera siamo perci√≤ andati o al Plaza Hotel oppure al Hotel Pierre. Una mattina abbiamo utilizzato il servizio in camera per la piccola colazione ed √® stata per√≤ molto buona Questo √® stato l'unico neo e comunque, data la centralit√† e la pulizia dell' albergo sicuramente ci ritorneremo."
Review 178,"Great stay! Super clean, fast elevators, small but nice free breakfast, excellent staff. Will definitely stay here again. Not one complaint!"
Review 179,"Stayed here with wife and two boys. Rooms huge by new York standards - think of an embassy suites type room with upgraded finishes. Room had kitchenette with mini frig and microwave. Two TVs, two large closets, nice bathroom. View was of building next door. Smallish common areas include a nice computer lodge, nice but smallish lobby, and a breakfast room where the continental breakfast is served. Breakfast has cereals, yogurts, pastries. Great midtown location within short walk of lots of attractions. Subway station one block north. Get the one week metro pass and you can travel all over thes city for the cost of one round trio cab ride. Overall, a great base to explore and a good value compared to other NYC hotels."
Review 180,"Very good loation and nice area easy to walk in the area for eating or some shopping.
Very clean.
Very comfortable."
Review 181,"I traveled to Houston for business and Hotel Sorella was highly recommended by several co-workers. The hotel exceeded my expections and I have high standards.
The hotel is located in City Center with a number of restaurants and shops in the complex. This was a big plus for my colleague and I after a long day at work.
The room was spacious, modern and spotless and the complimentary breakfast was a nice touch. The fitness facility was small but very clean and well maintained.
Overall I found the service to be very friendly and accommodating. I would definitely return to Hotel Sorella for business or pleasure the next time I'm in Houston."
Review 182,"This is by far the best hotel I have stayed in. Every part of the hotel is decorated in a unique, chic way. The beds are amazingly soft! Breakfast is open near the main lobby with lounges, couches and huge windows leading out to a patio. I also highly recommend the hotel bar, Mona Lisa."
Review 183,Stayed on first floor. Service excellent. Nicely decorated for Xmas. Looks brand new everywhere. Room very clean and modern. Excellent value for $55. Fabulous breakfast. Complete with Texas shaped waffles! Kids loved it!
Review 184,"Hotel Sorella for my birthday. I absolutely love this hotel. The decor is hip, the location is great. Shopping and night life is just steps away. The one thing I don't like about this place are the vallet guys. They're quick to try to hustle the guests. Other than that, great place to take a staycation."
Review 185,This hotel was fantastic! Modern and very pretty inside. Extremely quick check in and very clean rooms. The pool was small but nice and refreshing. We walked to Eddie V's and Yard House which were both fantastic as well. Great to have so many shopping and dining choices within walking distance.
Review 186,"Lots to do and can walk to many things - shopping, good restaurants all within striking distance. Great rooms"
Review 187,"We stayed at the Sorella one night for a little b-day getaway on the recommendation of a good friend. I love the interior of the hotel and the decor, very pretty. Check in was fast and the desk attendant was very polite. The room was very roomy with modern decor. We decided to walk around the City Center area for a bit that afternoon...I guess I didn't realize how new the whole area is, but there are still very few retail stores occupying the spaces, however there are several restraunts, and there is still construction going on around the area. We decided to have a cupcake at Sweet and then a drink at Yard House. Later in the evening we walked over to Brio for dinner. The general area around the hotel outside was just swarming with people...and was still equally packed when we came back over 2 hours later after dinner...lots of kids running around too which I thought was strange since it was after 10pm and it doesn't strike me as a kid or family oriented area. After dinner we decided to go up the the hotel bar, the Monnalisa, for drinks and some live music. The music and drinks were great...but unfortunately we didn't stay too long because it was absolutely packed in there and there was no seating available by the time we got there...very little offered to begin with. We would have been ok to stand for a while and enjoy the music, but for some reason there is a large fire pit in the center of the room. While it looks really cool, it's still fire and it really heated the place up! That heat combined with the muggy and hot Houston air flowing in and out as people walked out onto the patio just made it uncomfortable in there. Next time I'll make sure we get there early so we can get a table...far away from the fire! We weren't ready to turn in for the night so decided to go over to the large lounge area near the lobby...there was ample seating there inside as well as outside and only a few people over there. We ended up sitting for a while on the patio (2nd floor) and people watched below. When we returned to our room we found a bottle of champagne waiting for us on ice! Neither one of us ordered it and there wasn't a note (and we weren't charged for it) so I'm assuming it was just a gift from the hotel...Nice :) I do have to say that the walls are paper thin. I was unfortunately kept up several hours throughout the night because of some drunken fools banging and screaming. From what I could hear, I believe they were asked to keep it down several times either by hotel staff or other guests, but that seemed to only fuel their behavior. So, while the bad behavior of others certainly isn't the hotel's fault, the walls provided VERY little noise buffer! I booked the room package that included sunday brunch at the hotel restaurant, Bistro Alex. The food and service here are great. I highly recommend this package for the value. The brunch included in the package is not buffet, but on a normal menu and you can just order to your content as many courses as you like...even dessert! One adult beverage per person is included too. I recommend the steak migas...soooo good! There were also musicians playing jazz music throughout brunch with was great! Also, we did not use the pool, but walked by it several times and were surprised at how super-tiny it is! the lounges by the pool look really nice, but I was just really surprised at how small the area is as well as the pool itself. If you are planning on some pool time during your stay, I'd get down there early to claim a spot! All in all, we had a good expreience, minus the noisy drunk idiots of course, and will definitely consider this hotel again."
Review 188,"My husband and I stayed at the Sorella for the second time for a weekend getaway, and it was just as amazing the 2nd time around as our 1st stay. The rooms are extremely clean and the staff are very polite and professional!"
Review 189,"The La Quinta in Houston, Texas on Normandy, St is a very nice LQ Inns and Suites, however, the neighborhood is not so nice.
Sirens all night, lots of shady/shabby looking houses, building, people in the area. It is on I-10 on the east side of Houston...not the greatest part of town. However, it was very close where I needed to go and had good ratings as a nice, clean property...which it is.
The check in was quick, friendly. The room was clean, smelled good and the beds were warm, soft and I slept ok, considering the sirens and such.
The property does have a security fence around it, however it is not gated. They do employee a security guard and that does help.
The breakfast was ok, typical LQ with mega starch/carbs combo. I was in a hurry, so I did eat there. 
Park your vehicle in front in the lighted area. Don't venture off the property after dark.
All went well during the stay, I would stay again if needed on the east side of Houston."
Review 190,"Was in town to work on a Habitat project nearby. Decided to stay in a hotel rather than having to fight early morning traffic from the west side of Houston. Chose this La Quinta based on reviews and price. Nice, clean hotel, although the hotel had a strange smell in the halls. It may have been new carpet or something. We did have an initial problem with service at the front desk when we arrived and after waiting a while had to actually call the hotel to get a response. The clerk claimed to be having problems of some kind, but once we were checked in our stay was fine. Breakfast was very good and the attendants were pleasant and helpful. This La Quinta is nice and our stay was pleasant. If you need to stay on the east side of Houston near Interstate 10 and want a nice, comfortable room at a good price, then I recommend this hotel."
Review 191,"I planned a one-night visit to Houston, TX for business. My meeting was located only about a mile from this LaQuinta (there is another LaQuinta located only about a mile to the west), and I saw the great reviews on this site, so I decided to stay here. It was great. 
The rooms were clean, comfortable, and business-friendly. The front-desk staff and other employees were overly friendly. The free breakfast in the morning was very good. An excellent bargain, and I would not hesitate to stay here in the future. 
Final note: The hotel is located about 25 minutes from Hobby Airport and about 35-40 from Bush International."
Review 192,"Should you ever need to stay on the east side of Houston just off I-10 and 15 minutes from downtown (depending on the time of day), this is currently the best choice. La Quinta Normandy is very new. As a result, so are all the fixtures, carpet, TVs, luxurious King beds, bathrooms and so on. For a budget hotel, this place is positively luxurious.
The pool was clean, the breakfast decent for being included (eggs, bacon or sausage, along with fruit, cereal, bread, bagels etc) and the staff was friendly and helpful. I cannot think of anything that wasn't right with this place, right down to the microwave and bar fridge in every room. A great bargain!"
Review 193,"My husband and I like to take mini vacations at high end hotels and resorts in the area-- less cost because of the greatly reduced transportation expense and a chance to be pampered. At a friend's recommendation we booked the Sorella in the City Center area of Houston. It's a sleek hotel, refined lines, excellent beds, nice towels and bathrobes and from some rooms a great view. Nice pool, great deck chairs but a very small area and a tiny pool. Parking is valet or self. We tried the Brennan's cafe in the hotel and had a nice flat bread appetizer and a great martini-- service was friendly but slow. Great restaurants nearby and interesting shops. The room was only $179 per night. We'll go back soon!"
Review 194,"Got a Deluxe Room facing the ""green"" to watch the 4th of July Fireworks. Although the fireworks show only last 10 minutes, the hotel room was worth it. Beautifully clean and modern. The kids enjoyed swimming, but I wish the kids were not kicked out of the pool at 9pm. We would have enjoyed watching the fireworks from the pool area."
Review 195,"The Hotel was super clean, nice modern-retro design, We stayed in the Jr. Suite. Pretty roomy, and pretty pricey! We called the front desk for a mini fridge and had it delivered to our room in about 10 minutes. The view was great from room 915. The free continental breakfast is fruit, cereal and a few pastries. The location is great, in the middle of city center houston. Check out time is noon. Overall it was a great two night stay."
Review 196,"We try to use any excuse to celebrate a weekend at Hotel Sorella. In fact, we only 2 miles from the hotel but lavish in the fact that it feels like it could be ""anywhere"" when we stay there! My favorite things are the pool, the Mona Lisa Bar that open onto the pool deck with wait service, Bistro Alex (Ask for Stephen), the modern Decor, the nice hotel staff, the pastries for breakfast, CityCenter, the shopping (Anthropologie), the movie theater (Studio Movie Grill) and Lifetime Fitness (w/Spa). My 7 year old also enjoys everything this hotel has to offer!"
Review 197,"The Sorella is a nice, contemporary hotel. Quiet for hotel traveler. The area where it's located is developing nicely, walk to shops and restaurants, convenient for business traveler."
Review 198,"Dieses ist immer wieder eines meiner Favouriten in Houston - basierend auf Preis / Leistung.
Das Haus ist sehr sehr sauber, Top Zimmer im gewohnten Hilton Garden Inn Standard. Top Bett, Kaffeemaschine und K√ºlschrank.
WIFI und PArken ist f√ºr umme.
Es gibt ein Business Center und ein Fitmess Raum.
Fr√ºhst√ºck ist klasse - als HH Diamnond f√ºr umme, aber echt gut. Eier nach Bestellung zubereitet und der Rest vom Buffet.
Ein klares GO"
Review 199,"Sch√∂ne Zimmer und sind sehr gut eingerichtet. Service was ausgezeichnet und das Hotel bietet viele extras, die ein Hilton halt bietet, gratis Internet, das auch relativ gute Qualit√§t hatte. Das Fr√ºhst√ºck f√ºr 10 Dollar war auch sehr gut. Es hat ein sehr gut ausgestattetes Fitness Raum, was sehr zu empfehlen ist, aber am besten morgens kommen, denn es f√ºllt sich auch sehr schnell. Wie immer ist das Hilton zu empfehlen."
Review 200,"Quite a bit from the downtown, but if you you're in the area there's probably no better place to stay. Very good value for money. The breakfasts however are fruits and cereal only, so if you after some eggs and bacon you may be suprised (it's a healthy option though).
Amazing indoor sports/fitness centre just around the corner ($ 15 for an entry)."
